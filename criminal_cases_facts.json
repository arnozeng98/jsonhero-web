III.A preliminary inquiry against Primeau and Cornish was scheduled at the Saskatchewan Provincial Court for June 1993.  Lefort's preliminary inquiry, however, began in March 1993.  Primeau was subpoenaed to testify at Lefort's inquiry (an order of production was obtained, Primeau being on remand).  As a result, Primeau filed a motion seeking:  (1) relief unders. 24(1)of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsto prevent him from being compelled as a witness at the preliminary inquiry of Lefort; and, (2) a writ of prohibition to prevent the Provincial Court judge from compelling his presence at the inquiry, and to prevent him from being compelled to testify at that inquiry.  IV.The Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench granted Primeau's motion:  (1993), 108 Sask. R. 193.  The Crown's appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed:  (1993), 113 Sask. R. 4, 52 W.A.C. 4, 85 C.C.C.

        "Facts": " 6.                       On Saturday, June 8, 1991, at around 8:20 a.m., the body of Frank Boyle, aged 85 years, was found at his home on Cedar Creek Road in Likely, British Columbia.  He had died following a fierce attack involving five blows to the head, each of sufficient force to kill him, with an iron bar or similar object.  While the exact time of death could not be ascertained, he was last seen alive the previous evening.  The officer in charge of the investigation noted that blood was spattered everywhere at the Boyle residence, and noted also Sportsman brand cigarettes at the scene.  7.                       As a result of information provided by several bystanders, the three investigating officers went to the scene of a motor vehicle accident, which involved the deceased’s red Datsun pickup truck, about half a kilometre west of the Boyle residence.  Two local residents, Kelly Spurn and Cindy Potter, offered new information to the police.  Cindy Potter told the police that she had seen Boyle’s truck in the ditch at 6:45 that morning.  Furthermore, she stated that she had seen someone she identified as Michael walking in an easterly direction along Cedar Creek Road a few minutes earlier with a beer or a coffee cup in his hand.  The officer in charge testified that Kelly Spurn told him that the appellant was living on Spurn’s property which he was renting out to the appellant’s sister, Angela Feeney, and her spouse equivalent, Dale Russell.  Spurn suggested that the police go and speak to Russell.  Spurn testified that he had told the police that he assumed it was the appellant who had crashed the pickup truck because the skid marks and the location of the accident were in the same place as skid marks from another accident earlier that morning which had involved the appellant and a blue flatbed truck.  8.                       Upon arrival at the Spurn property where Dale Russell, Angela Feeney and the appellant were living, Russell told police that the appellant had stolen a truck from the Spurn property earlier that morning and that he found it just down from Boyle’s residence, exactly where Boyle’s truck was found later.  He also said that the appellant had come home at 7:00 a.m. after a night of drinking and was now asleep in the trailer behind his residence.  9.                       The officer in charge went to the windowless trailer and knocked on the door and said, “Police”.  Receiving no answer, he entered the trailer with his gun drawn and pointing downward, went to the appellant’s bed, shook the appellant’s leg and said “I want to talk to you.”   The officer then asked the appellant to get out of bed and move into the better light at the front of the trailer.  The officer stated in evidence that he did so in order to inspect the appellant’s clothes for  bloodstains.  The officer conceded that he may have touched the appellant in leading him to the  door.   The officer noticed blood spattered all over the front of the appellant and had another officer read the appellant his rights in these terms ((1995), 54 B.C.A.C. 228, at p. 230):  It is my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You may call any lawyer you want. A Legal Aid duty lawyer is available to provide legal advice to you without charge and can explain the Legal Aid plan to you.  If you wish to contact a Legal Aid duty lawyer, I can provide you with a telephone number. Do you understand?...You are not obliged to say anything but anything you do say may be given in evidence.   10.                     The appellant was arrested and asked whether he understood his rights.  He did not respond at first, but when asked again he stated (at p. 230), “Of course, do you think I am illiterate?” or words  to that effect.   The officer in charge immediately asked the appellant how he got blood on himself, to which the appellant replied that he had been hit in the face with a baseball the day before.  When asked whether a particular pair of shoes were the shoes he had worn the previous evening, the appellant replied that they were the only shoes he owned.  There was also some discussion with him about a package of Sportsman cigarettes observed in the trailer.  11.                     The appellant was led to the police vehicle where the tee shirt he was wearing was seized.  He was taken to the Williams Lake RCMP detachment.   At around 12:00 noon the appellant tried unsuccessfully several times to contact a lawyer.  At 12:17 p.m. he  left a message for the lawyer to call back.  At 12:23 p.m. a breathalyzer sample was taken from the appellant, who was not told that he had a choice in the matter.  The appellant was kept in an observation cell for over eight hours.  At 9:10 p.m. two detectives began questioning the appellant.  The appellant stated, at p. 231, “I should have a lawyer”, but the interview continued.  The appellant admitted to striking Boyle, stealing cigarettes, beer, and cash from  Boyle’s residence and stated that he had put the cash under his mattress in his trailer.  The police then obtained a search warrant authorizing them to seize the shoes, the Sportsman cigarettes, and the money under the mattress.  The appellant was interviewed again for approximately 1 1/2 hours at 3:05 a.m. on June 9.  The appellant had still not seen a lawyer.  On  Monday, June 10, at 9:25 a.m., and again at 10:54 a.m., the accused was fingerprinted.  In between these fingerprinting sessions the appellant met with a lawyer for the first time since he had been arrested.  12.                     The appellant was ultimately convicted of second degree murder following a jury trial in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed his appeal.

            "The appellant's appeal from conviction was heard on March 10 and 11 of 1988 before a five-person panel of the Court of Appeal for Alberta.  At the conclusion of the oral argument Kerans J.A. dismissed the appeal.  No written reasons were ever provided, although a formal judgment of the Court was rendered on April 6, 1988.  It is common ground between the parties that the following represents a fair summation of the oral reasons provided by Kerans J.A.  The Court of Appeal rejected a constitutional challenge to s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code  because it does not create a substantive offence, but rather simply classifies murder for sentencing purposes.  Kerans J.A. indicated that the inclusion of certain offences in s. 214(5) was not arbitrary, relying on this Court's decision in R. v. Paré, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 618.  The Court further held  that even if one assumes that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  violates s. 7  of the Charter  based on the decision in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, the verdict of the jury should be affirmed by application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .",

        "Facts": " The appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of Charmayne Manke and was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 25 years.  The Court of Appeal for Alberta dismissed, without written reasons, an appeal from conviction.  The body of the victim was found lying in a farmer's field at about 7:00 a.m. on April 14, 1984.  An autopsy revealed that she had 12 stab wounds to her neck and three to her head.  She bled to death as a result of a wound to her carotid artery.  At trial, evidence was adduced to establish that the appellant hailed a cab outside a gay night-club and asked the victim, the cab driver, to take him to his motel room.  When they arrived at the motel, the appellant asked her to wait for him while he picked up his luggage.  At that time the appellant also retrieved a knife from his room.  The appellant, upon his return, sat in the front passenger's seat.  A witness who observed the victim's driving testified that her driving pattern was very erratic following the departure from the motel. After his arrest, the appellant told the R.C.M.P. that he had been drinking and taking drugs before getting into the cab.  He remembered being in a field and wanting the cab driver's money.  When he took her money, he had the knife displayed.  At his request, the victim got out of the cab and his next memory was of his standing on the highway attempting to flag down a truck. In a later statement he remembered that he had initially pulled out the knife on entering the cab at the motel and told the victim to keep driving until he told her to stop.  It was further alleged that the appellant made an incriminating statement to another prisoner while in custody awaiting trial to the effect that he had stabbed the victim inside the cab and again outside the cab because she called him a \"faggot\".  The fellow inmate also testified that the appellant had made reference to having \"had control of where they were going\" in the cab.  In the course of its deliberations, the jury sent the trial judge two questions:  (1) \"what causes first degree murder to drop to second degree murder?\" and (2) \"please clarify forcible confinement a little more, that is, if the death occurred outside the cab, was the victim forcibly confined, if, for instance, she ran and attempted to escape, was caught by the accused and killed, was she forcibly confined at the time of death -- when does forcible confinement end?\"  The trial judge first noted that first degree murder does not \"drop\" to second degree murder and then responded in the following way:  It is not first degree murder if, and I will tell you in what circumstances it is not first degree murder, if you find on the facts that there was no forcible confinement.  It is not first degree murder if you find a robbery without a forcible confinement.  It is not first degree murder if you find no planning or deliberation but, once again, as I told you when I charged you, don't concern yourself with that one, because the Crown conceded that this is not a case of planning and deliberation and I concur, but there was some evidence that you might have found that in any event, so, I charged you on it.  So, that one I would suggest you should put aside....  It is not first degree murder if you find in fact you have a doubt as to whether the accused did form the intent to forcibly confine....  It is not first degree murder if you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the forcible confinement ended and this doubt must be resolved in favor [sic] of the accused.  Finally, it is not first degree murder if death occurred to facilitate flight after committing or attempting to commit forcible confinement. The jury returned about two hours later with a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. "

        "Facts": " 22The appellant, S.A.B., was accused of the sexual assault and sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old girl pursuant toss. 271and153(1)(a) of theCriminal Code.  The indictment stemmed from incidents that took place in Hinton, Alberta, around July of 1996.  A few months following the alleged sexual assault, the young complainant discovered that she was pregnant at which point she advised her mother that the appellant, S.A.B., who had been living with the complainant’s family for several months, had sexually assaulted her.  The complainant had an abortion and the police seized the fetal tissue for DNA testing.  23Pursuant to anex partewarrant authorizing the seizure of a blood sample under ss. 487.04 to 487.09, the police seized a blood sample from the appellant and conducted DNA analysis.  Typically, forensic DNA analysis will compare two samples of DNA to determine if they match.  In this case, the forensic DNA analysis compared the appellant’s blood sample with the fetal tissue (the combined DNA of the complainant and the accused) taken from within the complainant’s body in order to confirm or deny that the appellant had fathered the fetus.  Essentially, a paternity test was conducted with the appellant’s DNA.  Such use of the DNA is contemplated by the legislation per s. 487.05(1)(b)(ii).  The appellant was arrested and charged with sexual assault.  At trial, the appellant sought a declaration that the DNA warrant provisions in ss. 487.04 to 487.09 violatess. 7and8of theCharter.  24During the trial, evidence was presented that five of the seven DNA  samples taken from the appellant were conclusive and established the probability that S.A.B. was not the father of the fetus to be 1 in 10 million.  The sixth test sample was damaged and yielded inconclusive results. The seventh sample did not match the appellant’s DNA.  This non‑matching sample was determined by the Crown DNA expert to be a mutation and was therefore disregarded.  The DNA expert, Dr. Szakacs, testified that “mutations are well documented in paternity testing, and the international guidelines state that at least two exclusions have to be noted before parental exclusion can be determined”.  No evidence was given as to the nature of the international guidelines referred to.  If the non-matching sample was not a mutation, there would be no possibility that the accused was the father of the fetus.  The appellant argued that the opinion evidence of the DNA expert lacked a factual foundation.

        "Facts": " The respondent was charged with two counts of vagrancy under s. 179(1)(b) alleging that on or about July 5, 1989, he did commit vagrancy by loitering at Beacon Hill Park in Victoria.  The first count was framed as loitering \"at or near a playground\".  The second count, which referred to the same events, was framed as loitering \"in or near a public park\".  In 1987 the respondent was convicted of two counts of sexual assault contrary to the former s. 246.1(1) (now s. 271(1)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  These convictions made him subject to the prohibition set out in s. 179(1)(b).  On June 16, 1989, for about two minutes, Police Constable Ronald German observed the respondent standing in Beacon Hill Park in Victoria, British Columbia at the edge of a playground area.  Around his neck the respondent was carrying a camera with a telephoto lens.  The constable did not see the respondent take any pictures or approach or speak to any children.  The respondent then went to another area of the park.  Constable German followed the respondent and called to him.  The respondent stopped, and German identified himself and produced his badge.  He asked the respondent what he was doing in the park.  The respondent replied that he was walking through the park just as he did every day.  After some further discussion, the officer asked the respondent for his address, date of birth, and if he had a criminal record.  The respondent replied that he had a criminal record for sexual assault.  Constable German then told the respondent that his hanging around the park was contrary to the vagrancy section of theCode, and that a convicted sex offender was not permitted to loiter near a public park, school yard or playground.  The respondent asked the officer what he meant by \"loitering\", to which Constable German very astutely replied:  \"loitering meant standing around, apparently doing nothing, standing stationary in a location, or moving slowly in a certain area, stopping at regular intervals and standing around, or else loitering also could mean stopping in a location where it would obstruct persons who use that area too [sic] frequent\".  The officer did not charge the respondent, but warned him not to loiter near the playground at the park again.  On the afternoon of July 5, 1989, Constable Wayne Coleman observed the respondent walking on a pathway leading from the children's playground area in the Beacon Hill Park towards the petting zoo.  After stopping there for a few minutes, the respondent went to his car.  The respondent was once again carrying a camera with a large lens.  Constable Coleman, who was in plain-clothes, followed the respondent in an unmarked police car.  After driving around for approximately half an hour, the respondent returned to the park.  There, the officer saw the respondent seated at a table approximately 50 yards from the playground area.  He then moved to a bench approximately 20 yards from the playground and appeared to be using his camera.  Some five minutes later, the respondent left the park and returned to his car.  Constable Coleman followed the respondent to his residence, where he arrested Heywood and charged him with vagrancy.  The police seized his camera and film.  A search warrant was subsequently executed at his residence.  A picture on the film found in the camera, and a number of pictures found in the respondent's residence and at the drugstore where he had his photographs developed, showed young girls playing in the park, their clothing disarranged from play so that the area of their crotch, although covered by underclothes, was visible.  At his trial, the respondent pleaded not guilty and challenged the constitutionality of s. 179(1)(b) on the grounds that it infringedss. 7,11(d), (h),12and15of theCharter.  The trial judge found that s. 179(1)(b) violatedss. 7and11(d)of theCharter, but that it was a justifiable limit under s. 1.  The respondent was convicted of the first count of vagrancy under s. 179(1)(b).  The second count was conditionally stayed pursuant to the principle expressed inKienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.  The respondent was sentenced to three months incarceration to be followed by three years probation.  The respondent appealed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which dismissed his appeal.  The Supreme Court judge accepted the trial judge's finding that s. 179(1)(b) violatedss. 7and11(d)of theCharter, but like the trial judge found that they were justified under s. 1.  The respondent appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal allowed the respondent's appeal, and quashed the conviction.  Hutcheon J.A. (Rowles J.A. concurring) accepted the breaches of ss. 7 and 11(d) as found by the lower courts.  Southin J.A. only found a breach of s. 7.  All three judges of the Court of Appeal found that s. 179(1)(b) was not justified unders. 1of theCharter.  The Crown appellant was granted leave to appeal to this Court.

C-46 , and a total of 10 appendixes.  At his trial, Mr. Campbell took the position that the ITO was overly broad and insufficient as it related to his rented room.  He therefore brought an application to exclude the evidence of the shotgun and ammunition on the basis that his right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had been infringed.",
            "[10]                          The trial judge found four problems with the ITO.  First, the affiant blended the criminal records and backgrounds of the three tenants where only Mr. Imona-Russel’s background was relevant to the offence.  Second, the affiant overstated the tenants’ knowledge of each other’s comings and goings; at most the connection between the tenants would provide an opportunity to participate in the offence, which does not constitute reasonable and probable grounds.  Third, the affiant’s suggestion of a possibility that the units within the townhouse were not properly secured was mere speculation.  Fourth, the Chinese food receipt did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds to search Mr. Campbell’s room.  The trial judge also found the drafting of the ITO “intentionally confusing and opaque” (para. 18).  The trial judge concluded that Mr. Campbell’s s. 8 rights had been breached and she excluded the evidence under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .",
            "[11]                          Writing for a majority of the Court of Appeal, Juriansz J.A. found that the trial judge erred by focusing on a brief portion of the ITO, failing to consider relevant evidence and misapprehending parts of the evidence.  In particular, the trial judge disregarded relevant evidence when she referred to Mr. Campbell’s criminal record as “unrelated” and when she discounted the evidence of the black bags.  Of the three tenants, only Mr. Campbell had been convicted of offences involving violence against women, and only Mr. Campbell had been linked to black bags.  Juriansz J.A. also found that there was no evidence to support the trial judge’s conclusion that the drafting of the ITO was “intentionally confusing or opaque” (para. 30).  To the extent that some of the statements in the summary section of the ITO were incorrect, they should have simply been excluded and the balance of the ITO assessed to determine whether there were sufficient grounds for the issuance of the search warrant.  Given the errors committed by the trial judge, the usual deference could not be afforded to her findings and it fell to the court to determine whether there was a basis upon which the warrant could issue.  Juriansz J.A. concluded that the cumulative effect of the compelling inference that the murder was committed in the townhouse and the evidence of Mr. Campbell’s criminal record, access and opportunity, and possession of black bags constituted reasonable grounds to issue the warrant to search Mr. Campbell’s room.",
            "[13]                          However, Doherty J.A. disagreed that the four areas of evidence relied upon by the majority constituted sufficient grounds to justify the issuance of the warrant with respect to Mr. Campbell’s room. In particular, he did not consider that the evidence of the black bags or contents of the garbage bags found with the deceased provided any support for the application for a warrant to search Mr. Campbell’s room.  Weighing the remaining pieces of evidence of Mr. Campbell’s criminal record and his opportunity and access against a hypothetical analogy involving a 100-unit apartment building, Doherty J.A. concluded that these two facts did not alone establish a basis to authorize a search of Mr. Campbell’s room.  Doherty J.A. would therefore have affirmed the trial judge’s finding that the search was unconstitutional and her ruling excluding the evidence."

        "Facts": " [45]First, it is necessary to excise several misleading passages in the ITO that suggested Mr. Hounjet had actually viewed illegal pornography on the computer, rather than suspiciously labelled bookmarks (“Favourites”).  In particular, para. 5 of the ITO, the first to adduce specific facts in support of the application, contains two glaring and misleading inaccuracies.  It states, first, that “[o]nce on the computer HOUNJET observed ‘Lolita Porn’ on the screen”, and then that Mr. Hounjet “returned the next day to find the porn removed”.  [46]The clear implication of these assertions is that Mr. Hounjet in fact saw “Lolita Porn” (pornography involving young girls) on the screen and that he determined that this pornography was subsequently removed from the computer.  But Mr. Hounjet saw nothing of the sort.  As is clear from thevoir dire, all he saw were two links labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX” in the “Favourites” menu of the Internet browser.  “Favourites” or bookmarks are nothing more than “menu entries” that serve as shortcuts that provide easy access to an Internet site.  [47]Justice Deschamps finds (at para. 155) that “[t]here could be no confusion about what was seen.”  I respectfully disagree.  Nowhere does the ITO disclaim the clear statement in para. 5 that Mr. Hounjet saw “Lolita Porn” and that “the porn” was subsequently removed.  While para. 10 does specify that Mr. Hounjet saw “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX”icons, the last sentence of that very paragraph perpetuates the impression thatactualchild pornography (rather than links) was seen: It asserts that when Mr. Hounjet arrived the next day “all the child porn off the computer was gone”. [48]There is no reasonable basis for assuming that the justice of the peace would have understood these clear and misleading statements to refer exclusively to the icons mentioned in para. 10.  The natural reading of the ITO is that pornographic images of children were actually seen on the computer.  This is an entirely false claim, and these statements must therefore be excised from the ITO.  [49]Aside from false statements, the ITO in several places gave an incomplete and misleading account of the facts, in contravention of the informant’s duty to make full and frank disclosure of all material information.  [50]For example, thevoir direrevealed that the two bookmarks described in the ITO — the bookmarks labelled “Lolita Porn” and “Lolita XXX” — were “just scattered through the favourites” among additional links pointing to “regular adult material” (Testimony of Adrian Hounjet at thevoir dire, A.R., at pp. 98-100).  This is not mentioned at all in the ITO.  [51]Moreover, the only pornographic image that Mr. Hounjet actually did see — an image on the accused’s computer desktop or Internet homepage — was perfectly legal adult pornography.  The failure to mention these facts creates a misleading impression that the accused was particularly inclined towards child pornography or exclusively seeking it out.  [52]Once it is clearly understood that the suspicious “Favourites” were in fact anomalies or exceptions, found together with much more material that was undisputedly legal, the inference that the accused possessed illegal images — or that evidence of criminal possession would be found upon a search of the computer — becomes significantly less compelling.  [53]Similarly, the ITO placed great emphasis on the presence of a “web-cam pointing towards [children’s] toys”, and noted also that “[t]he client was alone in the house  with a three year old child” (ITO, at para. 5).  Indeed, these statements appear in the very first substantive paragraph of the ITO.  Later in the ITO, one learns that the webcam was not hooked up to the computer but was rather plugged into a VCR that recorded to videotape (para. 10).  [54]The descriptions of the webcam and its placement are juxtaposed immediately alongside the descriptions of the suspicious “Favourites” and the claims that Mr. Hounjet had “observed ‘Lolita Porn’”.  The ITO thus invited the justice of the peace to make an unwarranted connection between the two “Lolita” bookmarks and the webcam trained at the children’s play area.  Read as a whole, the ITO could thus be understood to allege that the accused had made and possessed his own illegal pornography, in addition to possessing images from the Internet on his computer.  [55]The informant’s narrative would have appeared much less sinister — and much less supportive of the claim that the accused possessed child pornography — had the ITO included a number of additional facts known to the police.  [56]First, the three-year old child mentioned (but not identified) in the ITO was in fact the accused’s daughter.  Second, the ITO stated that the accused was alone in the house with the girl, but failed to mention that his wife lived with them.  Third, the ITO failed to mention that the child was fully clothed, that there was no evidence of abuse, that the computer room had a child gate and appeared to double as a playroom for the child, and that the child was playing with the scattered toys in the middle of the room when Mr. Hounjet arrived, before being taken out of the room by the accused (A.R., at pp. 206-10).  [57]These omitted facts all tend to undermine suspicions about the accused.  Once they are added to the picture, it seems much more plausible that the accused was simply using the VCR and webcam to videotape his young daughter at play for posterity’s sake, rather than for any purpose connected to child pornography.  [58]In failing to provide these details, the informant failed to respect his obligation as a police officer to make full and frank disclosure to the justice.  When seeking anex parteauthorization such as a search warrant, a police officer — indeed, any informant — must be particularly careful not to “pick and choose” among the relevant facts in order to achieve the desired outcome. The informant’s obligation is to presentallmaterial facts, favourable or not.  Concision, a laudable objective, may be achieved by omitting irrelevant or insignificant details, but not by material non-disclosure.  This means that an attesting officer must avoid incomplete recitations of known facts, taking care not to invite an inference that would not be drawn or a conclusion that would not be reached if the omitted facts were disclosed.  [59]The relevant question here is whether the ITO was misleading, not whether it wasintentionallymisleading.  Indeed, in the Court of Queen’s Bench, the judge who had the benefit of observing the Crown’s witnesses on thevoir direfound no deliberate attempt to mislead.  That conclusion should not be disturbed.  It is nonetheless evident that the police officer’s selective presentation of the facts painted a less objective and more villainous picture than the picture that would have emerged had he disclosed all the material information available to him at the time.  [60]The facts originally omitted must be considered on a review of the sufficiency of the warrant application.  InAraujo, the Court held that where the police make good faith errors in the drafting of an ITO, the warrant authorization should be reviewed in light of amplification evidence adduced at thevoir direto correct those mistakes.  Likewise, where, as in this case, the police fail to discharge their duty to fully and frankly disclose material facts, evidence adduced at thevoir direshould be used to fill the gaps in the original ITO.  V  [61]The admissibility of the evidence obtained pursuant to the search and seizure of the appellant’s computer depends on two constitutional considerations.  The first is whether the search and seizure were unreasonable, within the meaning ofs. 8of theCharter; the second is whether admission of the evidence thereby obtained would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and should therefore be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2).  [62]The second question is only reached, of course, if the first is resolved in the appellant’s favour.  And that depends on whether the ITO, stripped of its erroneous and tendentious assertions, and amplified as indicated, provides sufficient credible and reliable evidence to have permitted the justice of the peace to find reasonable and probable grounds to believe both that the appellant was in culpable possession of child pornography and that evidence of that crime would be found in his computer.  [63]Essentially, only two inferential paths could have led the justice to conclude that the warrant should issue: (1) the two suspicious bookmarks; (2) the claims about the propensity of certain “types of offenders” to hoard images, combined with reason to believe that the accused is of that “type”.  In my view, both paths lead instead to an evidentiary dead end: they culminate in suspicion and conjecture, never reaching the mandatory threshold of reasonable and probable grounds to believe.  [64]The presence of the two “Lolita” links in the Favourites certainly supports a reasonable inference that the accused browsed a Web site that contained explicit images of females under the age of 18.  And it is not unreasonable to infer from the mere presence of the links on the appellant’s computer, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that they were knowingly added by him.  [65]This does not suffice, however, to establish possession.  First, as earlier explained, merely browsing a Web site or viewing images onscreen does not constitute  possession.  Neither does creating a bookmark on one’s computer establish possession over the content of the Web site: bookmarks merely provide quick and easyaccessto  the indicated Web sites.  Indeed, clicking on a bookmark may simply disclose that material previously on the Web site has been removed; that material previously absent has been added; that the Web site address is no longer valid — or that the Web site no longer exists at all.  [66]Accordingly, in order to commit the offence of possession (as opposed to the offence of accessing), one mustknowingly acquire the underlying data files and store them in a place under one’s control.  The presence of the icons might arouse suspicions regarding possession, but it does not alone support a reasonable inference that the appellant not only accessed the Web site and knowingly viewed illegal images located there, but also took the underlying data file into his control by saving it to the hard drive, or otherwise.  [67]Even if one takes the broader view that possession is complete on merely viewing images on-screen, other facts in the ITO preclude the possibility of inferring from the icons alone that evidence of the crime would be found in the appellant’s computer.  [68]Specifically, the ITO states that on the day after the icons were viewed, the computer’s hard drive was “formatted”.  On thevoir dire, it was confirmed that this meant that the entire contents of the hard drive were deleted.  Not only would the suspicious links have thus been erased, but illegal image files in the computer and any files evidencing past access to Web sites containing illegal images (such as browser histories or cache files) would also have been removed.  Normally, moreover, the greater the lapse of time after a hard drive has been formatted, the more likely it will be impossible to recover the former contents of the drive using forensic tools.  In this case, four months had passed.  And, in any event, the nature of “formatting” and data retention on computer drives was not sufficiently described in the ITO to permit issuance of the warrant on these grounds.  [69]To conclude that evidence of possession would be found four months after the hard drive was erased, one must therefore accept either that the accused had made external copies of illegal images present in the computer before formatting its hard drive or that he acquired additional illegal images after the formatting.  [70]Both possibilities require drawing inferences based on the likely behaviour of the accused.  The ITO seeks to establish the necessary inference on the basis of unsupported generalizations about the propensities of certain “types of offenders” to hoard and copy illegal images.  The ITO suggests that the accused is a person of that “type” and that, as a result, copies of the images would remain on the computer.  [71]In my view, the ITO does not establish either the veracity of the generalization about the alleged “type of offender”, nor that the accused is in fact the “type” to which the generalization might have applied.  [72]More specifically, the ITO makes two statements about the “propensities” of offenders.  It first states that “these type[s] of offenders are habitual and will continue their computer practices with child pornography” (ITO, at para. 12).  This claim is attributed to Corporal Boyce of the RCMP Technological Crime Unit.  The ITO also claims that “offenders treasure collections on their computer and like to store them and create backup’s [sic] in case they loose [sic] it.  Discs and floppy disks are used for this purpose.  Offenders will typically sort information and store pictures on different file names to catagorize [sic] them.” (ITO, at para. 13).  This statement is attributed to Constable Huisman of the Saskatoon Police Service Vice Unit.  [73]The main difficulty with these generalizations about certain “types of offenders” is that they are entirely devoid of meaningful factual support.  The ITO contains no evidentiary material in this regard, even anecdotal, apart from the bald assertion of the two police officers.  Furthermore, there is virtually nothing to describe, let alone establish, the expertise of the officers to whom the claims are attributed.  The only information provided in the ITO consists in the officers’ names, positions, and places of work.  This is surely an insufficient evidentiary basis to enable a justice of the peace, hearing an applicationex parte, to determine that the generalization is sufficiently credible or reliable to form the basis for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds.  [74]The amplification evidence presented on thevoir direis of little assistance to the Crown.  The failure to provide evidence of the officers’ expertise does not seem to be a mere “minor, technical error” that, in light ofAraujo, could be corrected with evidence adduced at thevoir dire.  In any event, it appears from this evidence that Cst. Ochitwa, the officer who prepared the ITO, believed Cst. Huisman to be an expert in crimes involving child pornography only on the basis of a recommendation from a prosecutor, his own impressions from talking to Cst. Huisman, and his understanding that Cst. Huisman had previously worked on unspecified “child exploitation offences”.  Cst. Ochitwa’s testimony does not mention any knowledge of the relevant experience that Cst. Huisman may have had or the basis for his opinions about the proclivities of child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 158-59 and 192-94).  [75]The evidence presented at thevoir direwith respect to Cpl. Boyce’s statements is more problematic still.  Cst. Ochitwa testified that he approached Cpl. Boyce in order to obtain information about “how computers operate” because “[Cpl. Boyce] was involved with the term [sic] technological crime”.  Cpl. Boyce thus appears to have been sought out as an expert oncomputer technology, not the habits of child pornography offenders.  While Cst. Ochitwa was aware that Cpl. Boyce worked in the Technological Crime Unit and knew what his duties were there — investigating crimes involving computers — there is no indication at all whether or how his work in that unit formed the basis for his opinions about child pornography offenders (Testimony of Cst. Ochitwa, A.R., at pp. 157-58 and 191-92).  [76]Perhaps even more troubling than the paucity of information as to the basis for the officers’ opinions is the fact that the class of persons to whom specific proclivities are attributed is defined so loosely as to bear no real significance.  Both officers speak about the propensities of undefined “types of offenders” or simply “offenders”.  [77]While it is clear from the context that the officers are referring to some variety of child pornography offenders, it cannot be assumed, without evidence, that broad but meaningful generalizations can be made about all persons who commit (or are suspected of committing) child pornography offences.  For example, a person with an exclusive interest in child pornography is surely of a different “type” than a person who is primarily or exclusively interested in legal adult images, but has nevertheless downloaded a small number of illegal images.  Similarly, a person who seeks out pornographic images of young children or infants is likely a different “type” than a person who views images of teenagers under the age of 18.  [78]These people all commit child pornography offences, but the “propensities” of one type may well differ widely from the “propensities” of others.  There is no reason to believe, on the basis of the information in the ITO, thatallchild pornography offenders engage in hoarding, storing, sorting, and categorizing activity.  And there is nothing in the ITO that indicates which specific subset of these offenders does generally engage in those activities.  [79]To permit reliance on broad generalizations about loosely defined classes of people is to invite dependence on stereotypes and prejudices in lieu of evidence.  I am thus unable to agree with Justice Deschamps (at para. 162) that the ITO’s claims in this regard could properly be relied on by the justice.  [80]Justice Deschamps supports her reliance on claims about the behaviour of “types of offenders” by citing child pornography cases in which courts, in her view, have accepted the tendency of certain kinds of child pornography offenders to collect many images and store them over long periods of time (para. 162).  These decisions are rather in favour of  the conclusion that an evidentiary basis is required to support a finding as to the characteristics or propensities of child pornography offenders.  [81]That some child pornography offenders do seek out and hoard illegal images is, of course, neither surprising nor helpful in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds exist in a particular case.  Still, it is not the role of courts to establish by judicial fiat broad generalizations regarding the “proclivities” of certain “types” of people, including offenders.  Matters of this sort are best left to be established by the Crown, according to the relevant standard — in this case, reasonable and probable grounds for belief.  As suggested earlier, moreover, courts must be particularly wary of endorsing such generalizations when, as in this case, the crime alleged is the subject of intense emotional responses and widespread condemnation, and the temptation to rely on stereotype rather that evidence is therefore especially dangerous and strong.  [82]An evidentiary basis is required as well for a finding of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the alleged offender belongs to the class of child pornography offenders whose characteristics or propensities are mentioned in the ITO.  This view of the law was adopted inR. v. Fawthrop(2002), 161 O.A.C. 350, the only Canadian appellate decision cited by Justice Deschamps.  My colleague finds in that decision support for her suggestion that general opinions on the propensity of child pornography offenders to collect and hoard child pornography material can give rise to reasonable and probable grounds for issuing search warrants.  With respect, I readFawthropdifferently.  As noted earlier,Fawthropaffirms the need for evidence both as to characteristics of an identified class of child pornography offenders, and as to the offender’s membership in that class.  [83]As Borins J.A., speaking for the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, explained inFawthrop(at para. 42):  In my view, the trial judge’s finding, based on the testimony of Det. Const. Pulkki, that the police were engaged in a “fishing expedition” for items of child pornography leads to the conclusion that the breach of the appellant’ss. 8Charterrights was serious. It appears from the record that after she interviewed A.Y. and members of her family, Det. Const. Pulkki suspected that the appellant was a pedophile, which led her to further suspect that he might possess items of child pornography. To be fair to her, she realized that her suspicion was insufficient to enable her to obtain a warrant. She was aware that it was necessary that she have reasonable grounds to believe that child pornography would be located in the appellant’s home. She sought the opinion of Dr. Collins in the hope that it would tip the scales from suspicion to reasonable grounds. As the trial judge recognized, the opinion of Dr. Collins failed to do so. He recognized the fatal flaw in the opinion. Although Dr. Collins opined that it was not uncommon for pedophiles to collect items of child pornography, he was unable to form an opinion as to whether the appellant was a pedophile. Without that link, Det. Const. Pulkki was in the same position as she had been before she contacted Dr. Collins. All she had was a suspicion that the appellant might be in possession of child pornography. . . . This resulted in an unauthorized search for those items by means of what the trial judge correctly labelled a “fishing expedition”. This is what the search warrant process is meant to prevent.  In the result, the evidence seized under the warrant was excluded pursuant tos. 24(2)of theCharter.  [84]In short, in most of the cases cited by my colleague, the original warrant application included relatively detailed descriptions of the habits of a specific class of child pornography offender.  They thus provided evidence sufficient to establish a credible profile of a class of child pornography collectors and their typical behaviours, and a proper factual foundation for concluding that the alleged offender belonged to that class.  This is not our case.  [85]Here, even if the impugned generalizations are accepted, the ITO as amplified does not reasonably permit the inference that the accused was the “type of offender” who sought out illegal pornography and stored it.  This requirement was well explained inUnited States v. Weber, 923 F.2d 1338 (9th Cir. 1990), at p. 1345: “[I]f the government presents expert opinion about the behavior of a particular class of persons, for the opinion to have any relevance, the affidavit must lay a foundation which shows that the person subject to the search is a member of the class.”  [86]Two suspiciously labelled links in the “Favourites” menu do not suffice to characterize a person as an habitual child pornography offender of the type that seeks out and hoards illegal images.  Indeed, the fact that the bulk of the pornographic material that Mr. Hounjet observed at the accused’s house was perfectly legal adult pornography suggests that the accused did not have a “pronounced” interest in child pornography at all, contrary to my colleague’s assertion (paras. 177 and 179).  [87]Also, and again with respect, the cases my colleague relies on (at para. 173) do not support the notion that a warrant can be issued months after a person might have merely viewed child pornography.  For example, inUnited States v. Terry, 522 F.3d 645 (6th Cir. 2008), the warrant was issued on a probable cause finding that the accusedhad in fact saved child pornography on his computer five months earlier.  Also, the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal inR. v. Graham, 2008 PESCAD 7, 277 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 103, neither upheld the warrant nor affirmed the trial judge’s finding as to the effect of the passage of time.  [88]More broadly, Justice Deschamps may be understood to permit reasonable and probable grounds for belief  to rest on evidence that has only a tenuous relation to the crime in question — possessing illegal child pornography.  [89]For example, my colleague is of the view that the presence of the webcam, which was functioning effectively as a camcorder recording to a VCR, “showed that [the accused] was interested in reproducing images, accumulating such material, and keeping it for his future use”, showed that the accused “was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography” (para. 179).  With respect, neither the legal nor the logical relevance of these considerations is apparent to me.  [90]While it may be true that the accused was adept at recording videotapes and storing the tapes for future use — as is nearly everyone who owns a camcorder — this says absolutely nothing about his propensity to store a completely different kind of image (child pornography), in a completely different medium (a computer, as opposed to videotape), acquired in a completely different manner (downloading, as opposed to filming).  [91]The mere fact that a person collects, reproduces, or storesanything— music files, letters, stamps, and so forth — hardly supports an inference that he or she is of the type to hoard illegal images.  To draw that inference here is to speculate impermissibly.  At its highest, the proposed inference might provoke suspicion in some.  And, as a matter of law, suspicion is no substitute for reasonable and probable grounds to believe either that the appellant committed the alleged offence or that evidence of the offence would be found in his computer.  [92]Nor do I consider that the accused’s conduct after the visit — tidying up the room and formatting the hard drive — supports the conclusion that the accused was the sort of person to seek out and hoard child pornography.  [93]Justice Deschamps contends that these actions were evidence of a “desire not to arouse suspicion with respect to his reproduction of images or his computer practices” and that the conduct created “a credibly based probability that the appellant was in the habit of reproducing and saving images and had a propensity to pornography, and more specifically to child pornography” (para. 179).  [94]In my view, there is an obvious and innocent explanation for this conduct that is at least as plausible: The accused might well have tidied up and formatted his computer simply to avoid further embarrassment from having an outsider see the disorderly state of his home and the evidence of his consumption of pornography on his computer.  Again, the accused’s conduct might raise suspicions, but it establishes nothing more.  [95]In short, as mentioned at the outset, the ITO in this case is reduced by scrutiny to two links in the browser’s list of “Favourites” — links that were known to have been erased four months earlier.  At best, this may be a ground for suspicion, but surely the deleted links afford no reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the appellant was in possession of child pornography, and still less that evidence of that crime would be found upon a search of his computer.  [96]Once the material facts omitted from the ITO are taken into consideration, it is apparent that none of the other evidence in the ITO — principally the presence of the webcam and the claims about propensities of unspecified “types of offenders” — can elevate mere suspicion into sufficient grounds for a warrant.  [97]Because the warrant should not have issued, the subsequent search violateds. 8of theCharter.  VI  [98]To determine whether the evidence obtained as a result of the illegal search should be excluded under s. 24(2), we are bound to apply the test recently set out inGrant, at para. 71:  [U]nder s. 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society’s confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of theCharter‑infringing state conduct (admission may send the message the justice system condones serious state misconduct), (2) the impact of the breach on theCharter‑protected interests of the accused (admission may send the message that individual rights count for little), and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.  The court’s role on a s. 24(2) application is to balance the assessments under each of these lines of inquiry to determine whether, considering all the circumstances, admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  I shall consider these three factors in turn.  [99]First, theCharter‑infringing state conduct in this case was the search of the accused’s home and the seizure of his personal computer, his wife’s laptop computer, several videotapes, and other items.  The search and seizure were unwarranted, but not warrantless: they were conducted pursuant to a search warrant by officers who believed they were acting under lawful authority.  The executing officers did not wilfully or even negligently breach theCharter.  These considerations favour admission of the evidence. To that extent, the search and seizure cannot be characterized as particularly egregious.  [100]The opposite is true on considering the ITO upon which the warrant was obtained.  The officer whopreparedthe ITO was neither reasonably diligent nor mindful of  his duty to make full and frank disclosure.  At best, the ITO was improvidently and carelessly drafted.  Not only did the ITO fail to specify the correct offence (accessing*rather than possession of child pornography); it was also drafted in a misleading way, resulting in the issuance of a warrant on insufficient grounds.  While the trial judge found no deliberate attempt to mislead, no attesting officer, acting reasonably, could have failed to appreciate that repeated references to “‘Lolita Porn’ on the screen” and to the deletion of “all the child porn off the computer” would cause most readers — and, more particularly, the issuing justice — to believe there was evidence that child pornography was actually viewed on-screen by the witness Hounjet. [101]Similarly, the officer should have known — if he in fact did not — that the immediate juxtaposition of these misleading statements and the incomplete description of the “web-cam pointing towards toys” would be unjustifiably inflammatory.  [102]The repute of the administration of justice is jeopardized by judicial indifference to unacceptable police conduct.  Police officers seeking search warrants are bound to act with diligence and integrity, taking care to discharge the special duties of candour and full disclosure that attach inex parteproceedings.  In discharging those duties responsibly, they must guard against making statements that are likely to mislead the justice of the peace.  They must refrain from concealing or omitting relevant facts. And they must take care not to otherwise exaggerate the information upon which they rely to establish reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of a search warrant.  [103]We are bound to accept the trial judge’s finding that there was no deliberate  misconduct on the part of the officer who swore the Information.  The repute of the administration of justice would nonetheless be significantly eroded, particularly in the long term, if such unacceptable police conduct were permitted to form the basis for so intrusive an invasion of privacy as the search of our homes and the seizure and scrutiny of our  personal computers.  [104]I turn in that light to the second factor set out inGrant: The impact of the breach on theCharter-protected interests of the accused.  The intrusiveness of the search is of particular importance in this regard.  Our concern here is with the search of the appellant’s home, in itself a serious breach of the appellant’s rights unders. 8of theCharter.  But there is more.  The infringement in this case involved a search of the appellant’s personal computer — and his wife’s laptop computer as well.  In passing, I  recall here the Informant’s failure to mention that the appellant lived with his wife.  This not only cast a dark light in the appellant’s presence alone with their child — perfectly understandable in the circumstances — but may also explain why the laptop, which was in fact not his, was seized and presumably scrutinized as well.  [105]As I mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine a more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one’s home and personal computer.  Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence.  They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations.  They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet.  [106]It is therefore difficult to conceive a s. 8 breach with a greater impact on theCharter-protected privacy interests of the accused than occurred in this case.  [107]I turn, finally, to the third factor to be weighed unders. 24(2)of theCharter— society’s interest in adjudication of the case on its merits.  Here, exclusion of the evidence obtained in the search would leave the prosecution with essentially no case against the accused.  It would thus seriously undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, a factor that weighs against exclusion (Grant, at paras. 79-83).  [108]In balancing these considerations, we are required byGrantto bear in mind the long-term and prospective repute of the administration of justice, focussing less on the particular case than on the impact over time of admitting the evidence obtained by infringement of the constitutionally protected rights of the accused.  [109]In my view, the repute of the administration of justice will be significantly undermined if criminal trials are permitted to proceed on the strength of evidence obtained from the most private “place” in the home on the basis of misleading, inaccurate, and incomplete Informations upon which a search warrant was issued.  [110]Justice is blind in the sense that it pays no heed to the social status or personal characteristics of the litigants.  But justice receives a black eye when it turns a blind eye to unconstitutional searches and seizures as a result of unacceptable police conduct or practices.  [111]The public must have confidence that invasions of privacy are justified, in advance, by a genuine showing of probable cause.  To admit the evidence in this case and similar cases in the future would undermine that confidence in the long term.  [112]I am persuaded for all of these reasons that admitting the illegally obtained evidence in this case would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  [113]I would therefore exclude that evidence and, since there was no possibility that the accused could have been convicted in the absence of the evidence, I would allow the appeal, quash the appellant’s conviction and enter an acquittal in its place.  The reasons of Deschamps, Charron and Rothstein JJ. were delivered by  [114]DeschampsJ. (dissenting) — Internet and computer technologies have brought about tremendous changes in our lives. They facilitate the communication of information and the exchange of material of all kinds and forms, with both legal and illegal content, and in infinite quantities.  No one can be unaware today that these technologies have accelerated the proliferation of child pornography because they make it easier to produce, distribute and access material in partial anonymity: Y. Akdeniz,Internet Child Pornography and the Law: National and International Responses(2008), at pp. 1-8. Not only do these technologies increase the availability of child pornography; they also raise new challenges, as  the criminal law must be adapted to apply to the making, distribution, and possession of such material, while the resulting offences must be investigated in a manner consistent with fundamental rights.  [115]The case at bar raises one such challenge. The appellant contends that the search of his computer breached his rights unders. 8of theCanadian Charterof Rights and Freedomsand that the evidence found on the computer should therefore be excluded and an acquittal entered on a charge of possession of child pornography (s. 163.1(4)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46). For the reasons that follow, I conclude that the reviewing judge did not err in upholding the decision to issue the warrant. Consequently, there is no need to addresss. 24(2)of theCharter. I would dismiss the appeal. "

        "Facts": " Basic fact presumptions can be further categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions.  A permissive presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact is drawn following proof of the basic fact.  A mandatory presumption requires that the inference be made.  Presumptions may also be either rebuttable or irrebuttable.  If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways the presumed fact can be rebutted.  First, the accused may be required merely to raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence.  Secondly, the accused may have an evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the truth of the presumed fact.  Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or a persuasive burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non-existence of the presumed fact.  Finally, presumptions are often referred to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact.  The latter entail \"frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence\" . . . while the former involve actual legal rules.  [Emphasis in original.]  A very useful analysis of presumptions that can be utilized in this case can be found in the writing of T. A. Cromwell in \"Proving Guilt: The Presumption of Innocence and theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\" in W. H. Charles, T. A. Cromwell and K. B. Jobson, eds.,Evidence and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms(1989), 125, at pp. 130ff. (which in turn is based on the analysis favoured by Professor Cross inEvidence(5th ed. 1979), at pp. 122ff., approved inOakes).  The presumptions can be summarized in this way:  1)  Presumptions which operate without the requirement of proof of any basic facts.  2)  Presumptions which require proof of a basic fact.  (a)  Permissive Inferences:  Where the trier of fact is entitled to infer a presumed fact from the proof of the basic fact, but is not obliged to do so.  This results in a tactical burden whereby the accused may wish to call evidence in rebuttal, but is not required to do so.  (b)  Evidential Burdens:  Where the trier of fact is required to draw the conclusion from proof of the basic fact in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  This mandatory conclusion results in an evidential burden whereby the accused will need to call evidence, unless there is already evidence to the contrary in the Crown's case.  (c)  Legal Burdens:  Similar to the burden in (b) except that the presumed fact must be disproved on a balance of probabilities instead of by the mere raising of evidence to the contrary.  These are also referred to as \"reverse onus clauses\".  The nature of the right to be presumed innocent set out ins. 11(d)of theCharterwas first considered inDubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350.  There Lamer J. (as he then was) was concerned with the nature of the right in connection withs. 13which provides protection against self-incrimination.  In that case he stated (at p. 357):  Section 11(d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or by calling other evidence.  Thus there is implicit in the right to be presumed innocent an obligation on the Crown to make out a case for the accused to meet before a response can be called for from the accused.  InSchuldt v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 592, this Court once again considered the presumption that had come before it inProudlock,supra.  Eventually the case turned upon whether an acquittal in the face of such a presumption constituted a question of law or a fact.  Nonetheless the decision is helpful in its qualification of the presumption.  It was held at p. 610 that:  But when the burden has been shifted (as is the case for proof of intent when a person is found in a place which he or she has broken into), it can be said, absent any evidence to the contrary, that there is no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could exist as regards the intent of the accused, and an appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a question of law alone.  In other words the presumption required the trier of fact to convict in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.  This presumption would come within category 2(b).  InR. v. Oakes,supra, the Court considered s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actwhich provided that if the Crown was able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had been in possession of a narcotic, then the accused was to be \"given an opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking\".  The section in effect required the accused to establish on a balance of probabilities that he did not have possession of the narcotics for purposes of trafficking.  It was held that s. 11(d) required that an individual must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; that the State must bear the burden of proving this; and proof of guilt must be accomplished \"according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal\".  Dickson C.J. applying this basic principle to the reverse onus provision contained in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Actconcluded at pp. 132-33 that:  In general one must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption  of innocence in s. 11(d).  If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue.  The Chief Justice went on to note that even though a rational connection might exist between the established fact and the presumed fact this may not be sufficient to render the presumption constitutional.  On page 134 he stated:  A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt.  An accused person could thereby be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt.  This would violate the presumption of innocence.  Contrary to the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dickson C.J. stressed that the rational connection between the proven and the presumed fact is better taken into account when analyzing the effect ofs. 1of theCharteron the impugned legislation, rather than in the process of determining whether s. 11(d) had been violated.  The principles set forth inOakeswere applied inR. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, wheres. 213(d) of theCriminal Codewas questioned.  The section provided that the offence of murder was committed if the accused used a weapon or had it on his person at the time he commits or attempts to commit an offence or during flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence.  Thus a conviction of murder was possible although the accused had neither an objective nor subjective intent to kill the victim.  Lamer J. speaking for the majority of the Court concluded that the Crown was required to prove all elements of the offence together with those required to satisfys. 7of theCharter.  He found that any provision which created an offence which allowed for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringeds. 7and s. 11(d).  He wrote at pp. 654-55:  These essential elements include not only those set out by the legislature in the provision creating the offence but also those required bys. 7of theCharter.  Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an accused notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element infringesss. 7and 11(d).  Clearly, this will occur where the provision requires the accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an essential element of the offence by requiring that he raise more than just a reasonable doubt.  It is for this reason that this Court struck down the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of theNarcotic Control Act.. . .  Sections 7 and 11(d) will also be infringed where the statutory definition of the offence does not include an element which is required under s. 7.  He then cited the words of Dickson C.J. inOakes,supra, set out earlier and continued:  It is clear from this passage that what offends the presumption of innocence is the fact that an accused may be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential element of the offence, and I do not think that it matters whether this results from the existence of a reverse onus provision or from the elimination of the need to prove an essential element.  . . .  Finally, the legislature, rather than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute proof of a different element.  In my view, this will be constitutionally valid only if upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.  If the trier of fact may have a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes ss. 7 and 11(d).  InR. v. Whyte, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3, the accused was charged with having the care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired.  The accused was found in the driver's seat of an automobile, slumped over the steering wheel.  The keys were in the ignition but the engine was not running.  The Crown relied on the same presumption considered inAppleby,supra, which placed the burden on an accused found in the driver's seat of establishing the absence of an intention to enter the vehicle for the purpose of setting it in motion.  The presumption was challenged and it was found that it did in fact infringe s. 11(d).  It was held that the word \"establishes\" required proof on a balance of probabilities.  The Crown argued that the section only required proof of an excuse rather than a disproof of any essential element of the offence.  That argument was not accepted.  Dickson C.J. for the Court stated at p. 18:  The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the presumption of innocence.  He then continued:  If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused.  . . .  In the passage fromVaillancourtquoted earlier, Lamer J. recognized that in some cases substituting proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if, upon proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential element.  This is another way of saying that a statutory presumption infringes the presumption of innocence if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt.  Only if the existence of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the conclusion that the essential element exists, with no other reasonable possibilities, will the statutory presumption be constitutionally valid.  It was held that the presumption in that section did not have that required \"inexorable\" character and thus failed the test proposed inOakesandVaillancourt.  InR. v. Kowlyk, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 59, the validity of a conviction based solely on the doctrine of recent possession was questioned.  McIntyre J. held that the provision created no more than a permissive presumption from which the trier of fact may, but not must, draw an inference of guilt of theft from the possession of recently stolen property.  He put his position in this way at pp. 71-72:  . . . where an explanation is offered for such possession which could reasonably be true, no inference of guilt on the basis of recent possession alone may be drawn, even where the trier of fact is not satisfied of the truth of the explanation.  The burden of proof of guilt remains upon the Crown, and to obtain a conviction in the face of such an explanation it must establish by other evidence the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  InR. v. Keegstra, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, the presumption of innocence was again considered.  The appellant was charged under a section which provided for relief from conviction if it could be established \"that the statements communicated were true\".  Once again the section was challenged as contravening s. 11(d).  Dickson C.J. confirmed that the presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  He reviewed the reasons inWhyte,supra, and then put forward his position in these words (at p. 790):  As is evident from the above quotation, the categorization of a factual finding as forming an element \"essential\" to the offence is of no consequence when determining whether s. 11(d) has been breached.  Applying the approach taken inWhyteto this appeal, it is obvious that s. 319(3)(a) runs afoul of the presumption of innocence.  Contrary to the arguments of those who would find s. 319(3)(a) compatible with s. 11(d), it matters not that the defence of truth may be intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction.  What is of essence is not the \"essential nature\" of the crime, but that the trier of fact will have to convict even where there is a reasonable doubt as to the truth of an accused's statements.  Perhaps it may be helpful to summarize the principles to be derived from the authorities.  I - The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  II - If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d).  Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.  III - Even if a rational connection exists between the established fact and the fact to be presumed, this would be insufficient to make valid a presumption requiring the accused to disprove an element of the offence.  IV - Legislation which substitutes proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if as a result of the proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the other element.  To put it another way, the statutory presumption will be valid if the proof of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the proof of the other.  However, the statutory presumption will infringe s. 11(d) if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt.  V - A permissive assumption from which a trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt will not infringe s. 11(d).  VI - A provision that might have been intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction will nonetheless contravene theCharterif the provision (such as the truth of a statement) must be established by the accused (seeKeegstra,supra).  VII - It must of course be remembered that statutory presumptions which infringe s. 11(d) may still be justified pursuant tos. 1of theCharter.  (As for example inKeegstra,supra.)  It is now necessary to apply these principles to the presumption set out in s. 195(2) to determine whether it contraveness. 11(d)of theCharter.  Application of the Principles Pertaining to Section 11(d) to the \"Living on Avails\" Provision  The presumption contained in s. 195 infringess. 11(d)of theChartersince it can result in the conviction of an accused despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  For example consider the situation of a spouse or companion of a prostitute, who is working, self-supporting and not dependent or relying upon the income garnered by the spouse or companion from prostitution.  There is nothing parasitical about such a relationship.  Neither being a prostitute nor being a spouse of a prostitute constitutes a crime.  Yet as a result of the presumption, the spouse could be found guilty despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.  The fact that someone lives with a prostitute does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the person is living on avails.  The presumption therefore infringes s. 11(d).

The appellant was armed with a knife and his accomplice with a gun. During the robbery, the appellant remained near the front of the hall while the accomplice went to the back. There was a struggle between the accomplice and a client. A shot was fired and the client was killed. The accomplice managed to escape and has never been found. The appellant was arrested at the scene.  4In the course of his testimony, the appellant said that he and his accomplice had agreed to commit this robbery armed only with knives. On the night of the robbery, however, the accomplice arrived at their meeting place with a gun. The appellant said that he objected because, on a previous armed robbery, his gun had discharged accidentally, and he did not want that to happen again. He insisted that the gun be unloaded. The accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to the appellant. The appellant then went to the bathroom and placed the bullets in his glove. The glove was recovered by the police at the scene of the crime and was found at trial to contain three bullets. The appellant testified that, at the time of the robbery, he was certain that the gun was unloaded. "

        "Facts": " 4The facts of these cases are not controversial, nor are they determinative.  Accordingly, all three matters can be briefly summarized as follows.  5InLavallee, the R.C.M.P. obtained a search warrant in the regular form and wording pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Codeon  January 16, 1996.  The search was to be executed on the following day at the law firm of Lavallee, Rackel & Heintz, in the City of Edmonton, targeting correspondence, estate files, trust records and other documents in relation to Mr. Andy Brent Polo, an individual suspected of money laundering and of being in possession of proceeds of crime.  When the R.C.M.P. arrived at the law firm to execute the warrant, a solicitor who was familiar with the documents in question claimed solicitor-client privilege.  The searching officers accordingly followed the procedure set out ins. 488.1of theCriminal Code: the documents were sealed in envelopes, summarily identified and taken into police custody.  The next day, January 18, 1996, counsel retained by the law firm moved in the Court of Queen’s Bench to fix a date and place for a judicial determination of privilege in reference to the seized documents in accordance with s. 488.1(3).  In April 1996, the law firm gave notice of a constitutional question, alleging the unconstitutionality ofs. 488.1of theCriminal Code.  The law firm and Mr. Polo also moved to quash the warrant but the application was denied in part by Dea J.:  (1997), 199 A.R. 21 (Q.B.).   In 1998,  Veit J. struck down s. 488.1 as unconstitutional:  (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Alta. Q.B.).  The appeal from that order was dismissed unanimously by the Court of Appeal for Alberta: (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 187.  6InWhite, a search warrant  was obtained to search the law offices of Raymond P. Whelan, including all storage facilities occupied by him at the law firm of White, Ottenheimer & Baker, in the City of St. John’s, Newfoundland.  The warrant authorized officers of Revenue Canada to search the premises for documents relating to Daley Brothers Ltd. and Mr. Terry Daley who were suspected of the offences described ins. 239(1)(a) and (d) of theIncome Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).  When the search was executed on June 30, 1998, a partner in the appellant law firm claimed solicitor-client privilege with respect to the targeted documents and, as a result, pursuant tos. 488.1of theCriminal Codeands. 232of theIncome Tax Act, the documents were sealed and taken into police custody.  On July 9, 1998, the law firm moved to set a date and time for the determination of privilege under boths. 488.1(3)of theCriminal Codeands. 232(4)of theIncome Tax Act.    On January 29, 1999, the appellants applied for a declaration thats. 488.1of theCriminal Codeands. 232of theIncome Tax Actare contrary tos.  8of theCanadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms. Halley J. of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, Trial Division, dismissed the application.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in part, resorting to the remedial techniques of severance and reading-in to salvage the impugned section of theCriminal Code:  (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 28.  7InFink, a search warrant was executed at the law firm of Turkstra, Mazza Associates on February 8, 1999, in the City of Toronto, targeting documents relating to the appellant Jeffrey Fink who was suspected of various counts of fraud over $5,000.  As result of the claim of solicitor-client privilege made on behalf of the appellant by counsel, the search was carried out according to the procedure set out ins. 488.1of theCriminal Codeand the documents were taken into police custody.  On November 11, 1999, the appellant applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for an order declaring s. 488.1 to be inconsistent withs. 8of theCharter.  Dambrot J. dismissed the application:  (2000), 143 C.C.C.

        "Facts": " In October of 1983, Owen Swain was arrested and charged with assault and aggravated assault, contrary toss. 245and 245.2(2) of theCriminal Code(nowR.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, ss. 266and268).  These charges arose from an incident in which the appellant, Mr. Swain, attacked his wife and two infant children in a bizarre manner.  Fortunately, Mrs. Swain and the children sustained only superficial physical injuries.  At trial, the appellant's wife testified that during the incident Swain appeared to be fighting with the air and talking about spirits.  At the time of his arrest, the appellant was very excited and spoke in a \"dialect\" about religious themes.  Mr. Swain testified at trial that, during the incident, he felt his family was being attacked by devils and that he had to protect them by carrying out certain acts.  On November 1, 1983, the appellant was transferred from the Toronto Jail to the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre pursuant to a Form 1 application under theMental Health Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 262.   While at the Centre, Swain behaved in a bizarre and regressive manner.  Two anti-psychotic drugs were prescribed and administered to him and his condition improved rapidly.  By December 19, 1983, the appellant was released into the community (on the condition that he would continue to see a psychiatrist) on the recommendation of Dr. Fleming, the Director of the forensic unit at the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre.  Mr. Swain returned briefly to jail and was granted bail on conditions shortly thereafter.  The appellant remained on bail until June 10, 1985, and continued to take medication and to see a psychiatrist.  On May 3, 1985, Mr. Swain's trial took place in the District Court of Ontario before O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.  At trial, the Crown sought to adduce evidence with respect to insanity at the time of the offence, to which the appellant objected.  After conducting avoir dire, the trial judge ruled that the Crown could adduce such evidence.  At the conclusion of the trial, Mr. Swain was found not guilty by reason of insanity on all counts.  Defence counsel then moved to have s. 542(2) of theCode(now s. 614), which provides for the automatic detention at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor of an insanity acquittee, declared inoperative on the basis that it violated theCharter. O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. reserved judgment and on June 10, 1985, held that Mr. Swain's constitutional rights were not infringed by s. 542(2) and ordered that the appellant be kept in strict custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto until the Lieutenant Governor's pleasure was known.  Mr. Swain filed a notice of appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal and applied for bail pending appeal.  Martin J.A., in Chambers, adjourned this application in order to permit an early hearing of the appellant's case by the Advisory Review Board (the body which may be appointed to advise the Lieutenant Governor concerning the detention of insanity acquittees).  On June 12, 1985, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant further detaining the appellant in safe custody in a mental hospital for assessment and report to the Advisory Review Board within 30 days.  Neither the appellant nor his counsel received prior notice of this decision, although it would appear that some attempts were made to notify the appellant's counsel.  Accordingly, neither the appellant nor his counsel made submissions with respect to this decision.  Pursuant to the above-mentioned warrant, Mr. Swain was sent for psychiatric examination and assessment to the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, where he remained a patient in the forensic unit until July 12, 1985.  The Advisory Review Board held a review hearing on July 26, 1985, pursuant to the provisions of s. 547 of theCode(now s. 619).  The appellant and his counsel were present at this hearing.  On August 6, 1985, the Advisory Review Board recommended to the Lieutenant Governor that Mr. Swain should remain in safe custody at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre.  Shortly thereafter, the Lieutenant Governor issued a warrant for the further detention of Mr. Swain.  The Lieutenant Governor accepted the recommendations of the Board which provided,inter alia, that the administrator of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre have the discretion to permit the appellant to re-enter the community with conditions as to supervision and follow-up treatment.  On two occasions (July 30, 1985 and August 20, 1985), the appellant's counsel wrote to the Lieutenant Governor requesting the right to appear and make submissions before the Lieutenant Governor at the time when the recommendation of the Advisory Review Board would be considered.  This request was not granted.  It was not until after the Lieutenant Governor's warrant for the further detention of Mr. Swain had issued that the recommendation of the Advisory Review Board was released to the appellant's counsel.  The appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was heard in early September, 1985.  A majority of the Court of Appeal (perThorson J.A.) dismissed the appeal, Brooke J.A. dissenting.  The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court, which application was granted on March 26, 1987.  At the time that the application for leave to appeal was filed, the appellant was in safe custody.  However, on September 4, 1986, the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario ordered that his warrant detaining the appellant be vacated and that the appellant be discharged absolutely.

        "Facts": " The respondent, David Grant, was acquitted of charges of unlawful cultivation of marihuana and possession of marihuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to ss. 6(1) and 4(2)NCA.  The acquittal resulted from the exclusion from evidence of a number of items seized during a search conducted under a warrant issued pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code.  The basis for exclusion was that statements made in the information sworn in order to ground the warrant request included information obtained during warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent.  The trial judge found these warrantless searches to be in violation ofs. 8of theCharter.  In a routine roadblock check conducted on April 29, 1989, a truck driven by the respondent, who purported to reside in an apartment in Victoria, British Columbia, was found to contain a number of items consistent with a marihuana growing operation.  On May 23, 1989, a police officer had received information from what he claimed to be a previously reliable but confidential informant that at the time of the roadblock, the respondent had been on his way to set up a marihuana growing operation and that he was part of an organization cultivating marihuana on south Vancouver Island.  The police later conducted two warrantless perimeter searches of the residence used by the respondent, a two‑storey building at 11110 Trillium Place, Sidney, British Columbia.  On September 7, 1989, two officers entered onto the property looking for signs of marihuana cultivation.  During a search of the perimeter, they observed several things which would have been impossible to have observed without entering onto the property.  They noted covered windows on the lower floor, heard what they described as the sound of electric motors or fans emanating from inside the residence and noticed two air vents which looked recently installed.  Later that day, the police observed the respondent leave the Trillium Place residence and followed him to an apartment in Victoria.  On September 20, 1989, the respondent was observed carrying what appeared to be fertilizer or weed sprayer from the Victoria apartment to the Trillium Place residence.  On September 21, 1989, two police officers conducted a second perimeter search of the Trillium Place property and noted that the basement windows appeared to be sealed with plastic and were wet with condensation.  The police officers testified, and it was admitted by the respondent, that they had reasonable grounds to believe that the Trillium Place residence constituted a dwelling‑house which contained a narcotic in respect of or by means of which a narcotics offence had been committed, prior to the first entry onto the property.  Further, the police conducted inquiries of B.C. Hydro and were able to determine that recent electrical consumption at the Trillium Place property had been unusually high compared with other similar area residences.  Based on an information that included the pieces of information gleaned in May, 1989, the inquiries made of B.C. Hydro, as well as the observations made during the two warrantless perimeter searches, on September 22, 1989 the R.C.M.P. obtained search warrants pursuant tos. 487of theCriminal Code.  These warrants authorized \"peace officers\" to search the Trillium Place address and the Victoria apartment.  The respondent was arrested at his business, advised of his rights and given copies of the warrants.  On execution of the warrants, the police discovered 80 plants which were later identified as marihuana, a variety of growing equipment at the Trillium Place address and a small amount of marihuana, drug‑related paraphernalia and documents at the Victoria apartment.  The respondent was acquitted of the charges referred to above when the evidence obtained in the searches and seizures was excluded by reason of a violation ofs. 8of theCharter. "

        "Facts": " 36Notwithstanding the many weaknesses in the evidence given by C., the trial judge found C. to be a credible witness.  According to the trial judge, C.'s \"impreciseness respecting dates\" did not \"lessen his credibility\" (p. 298).  In addition, the trial judge found that C.'s past dishonesty  did not bring C.'s credibility into question.  As a result, the trial judge accepted C.'s evidence and found it to corroborate the evidence of E. in respect of the \"ointment incident\".  The accused was therefore convicted of having indecently assaulted both complainants.  It is significant that the trial judge was not prepared to accept E.'s evidence except in respect of the one incident which was, in her view, corroborated by C.  37In my view, the obvious inconsistencies and falsehoods in the testimony of C. render the trial judge's finding of credibility unreasonable.  I simply cannot accept that any trier of fact, acting judicially, could have found any merit in the claims of either C. or E.  Moreover, given the frailties in the evidence of these two witnesses and the strong possibility of collusion, reliance by the trial judge on the evidence of C. to corroborate E.'s testimony was unreasonable.  38In finding that there was no collaboration between the complainants C. and E., the trial judge stressed the fact that C. had never had access to the newspaper reports in which E.'s statements had appeared.  Because there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that C. had learned the details of E.'s allegations through the media, the trial judge held that C.'s account of abuse had not been tainted by prior knowledge of the statements made by E.  With respect, this ignores the possibility that C. may have learned the details of E.'s story through contact with their common lawyer, Harry Kopyto.  The trial judge appears to have failed to notice that both complainants had been in contact with Kopyto.  Without referring to the obvious possibility of contact through a common lawyer, the trial judge took the view that there was \"no evidence that prior to [S.E.] or [D.C.] making their respective complaints to the police there was any contact between the two\" (p. 300).  Clearly, contact between the complainants and Harry Kopyto constitutes evidence of possible contact between the complainants, or at least the possibility that C. was exposed to the details of E.'s allegations.  Obviously, this raises a risk or possibility that C.'s claims against the accused arose from his knowledge of the statements made by E.  39There is a considerable body of authority to the effect that when an issue of the possibility of collusion or collaboration is raised, evidence of similar acts should not be admitted absent a finding by the trial judge that there is no real possibility of collusion or collaboration.  SeeCross on Evidence(7th ed. 1990), at pp. 364-65, andHoch v. The Queen(1988), 165 C.L.R. 292 (H.C. Austr.).  40InDirector of Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421 (H.L.), at p. 444, Lord Wilberforce stated that where a real possibility of collusion can be found:  ... something much more than mere similarity and absence of proved conspiracy is needed if this evidence is to be allowed.  This is well illustrated byReg.v.Kilbourne[1973] A.C. 529 where the judge excluded \"intra group\" evidence because of the possibility,as it appeared to him, of collaboration between boys who knew each other well.  This is, in my respectful opinion, the right course rather than to admit the evidence unless a case of collaboration or concoction is made out.  [Emphasis in original.]  41As a result of its more recent decisions inDirector of Public Prosecutions v. P., [1991] 2 A.C. 447, andR. v. H., [1995] 2 A.C. 596, the House of Lords is now of the view that, generally, the possibility of collusion is not a factor to be applied by the trial judge in determining the admissibility of this type of evidence.  This Court has not decided the question although it was my view in my dissent inR. v. B. (C.R.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717, that before similar fact evidence is admitted, the risk of collusion must be negatived by a finding by the trial judge.  The majority did not express an opinion on the point.  42The appellant did not contest the mutual admissibility of the evidence of E. and C. in respect of the counts relating to each.  It is therefore not appropriate for this Court to attempt to resolve this difficult legal question in this case.  But, assuming the evidence is admissible, the question arises as to what weight, if any, ought to have been given to it as corroborative evidence.  43This question was considered by the House of Lords inR. v. H.,supra.  The appellant was charged in separate counts with sexual offences committed upon his adopted daughter and stepdaughter respectively.  There existed sufficient similarity between the evidence of the two complainants to meet this requirement for admission as similar act evidence.  Admissibility was, however, contested on the ground that a real possibility of collusion existed.  The trial judge directed the jury that, if they were sure that the complainants had not collaborated, then the evidence of one of them could corroborate that of the other.  The House of Lords dismissed an appeal from a judgment upholding the charge.  Lord Mackay of Clashfern L.C. stated, at p. 612, that where a question of  collusion has been raised the judge must clearly draw the importance of collusion to the attention of the jury and leave it to them to decide whether, notwithstanding such evidence of collusion as may have been put before them, they are satisfied that the evidence can be relied upon as free from collusion and tell them that if they are not so satisfied they cannot properly rely upon it as corroboration or for any other purpose adverse to the defence.  44Lord Lloyd of Berwick and Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead agreed with Lord Mackay.  Lord Griffiths and Lord Mustill would apparently have left it to the jury to determine what weight, if any, should be given to the evidence.  The majority reasons of Lord Mackay would, therefore, leave it to the jury to decide as a preliminary question of fact whether the evidence is tainted by collusion.  If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence must be disregarded.  This would in effect leave it to the jury to decide whether the evidence was admissible.  While unusual, a similar approach has been approved by this Court in relation to the co-conspirator exceptions to the hearsay rule.  SeeR. v. Carter, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938.  See alsoR. v. Evans, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 653.  The more conventional approach adopted by Lords Griffiths and Mustill is that once the trial judge decides that the evidence is admissible, it is the trier of fact who determines what weight, if any, is to be given to the evidence having regard to all the circumstances, including the possibility of collusion.

        "Facts": " 2.On September 23, 1983, the appellant, Thomas Patrick Lyons, was arraigned on an information containing four charges: unlawfully breaking and entering a dwelling house contrary tos. 306(1)(b) of theCriminal Code; unlawfully using a weapon or imitation thereof in committing a sexual assault, contrary to s. 246.2(a) of theCode; unlawfully using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, contrary to s. 83(1)(a) of theCode; and unlawfully stealing property of a total value exceeding $200, contrary to s. 294(a) of theCode. These offences were alleged to have been committed approximately one month after the appellant's sixteenth birthday.  3.The appellant elected trial by a judge without a jury on all four charges and waived his right to a preliminary inquiry. He subsequently entered pleas of guilty to all counts in the indictment. O Hearn Co. Ct. J. of the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for District No. 1, Nova Scotia, requested a pre‑sentence report and adjourned the matter of sentence.  4.Just before the sentence hearing on November 4, 1983, defence counsel was informed, for the first time, that the Crown might bring a dangerous offender application under Part XXI of theCode. At the commencement of the hearing, the Crown requested and was granted an adjournment to permit it to consider bringing such an application. The application was subsequently made. On November 8, 1983, consent to the application was obtained from the Deputy Attorney General of Nova Scotia, as required by s. 689(1)(a) of theCode.  5.At the commencement of the hearing of the application on December 14, 1983, an agreed upon statement of facts was read into the record. Evidence, including expert psychiatric testimony, was tendered on behalf of both the Crown and the appellant.  6.Though O Hearn Co. Ct. J. had at the outset warned the Crown attorney that he would have an \"uphill fight\" owing to the age of the appellant, the judge in the end found, on the basis of medical and other evidence presented to him, that it had been established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant qualified as a dangerous offender under the provisions of theCode. In his view, it had been shown that the appellant had a \"sociopathic personality\" and had so little conscience that it did not govern his actions. He concluded that it could be said with \"a high degree of confidence\" that it was \"very likely\" that the appellant would constitute a danger to the psychological or physical health and lives of others owing to \"his in‑built, perhaps congenital indifference to the consequences to others, his lack of affect, his lack of feeling for others\". He belonged, the judge stated, to a class of people who, though mentally able to understand the law and to conform their conduct to its dictates, are so irresponsive to the law that they must be dealt with by extraordinary measures.  7.O Hearn Co. Ct. J. also considered and rejected the appellant's contentions that Part XXI of theCodewas constitutionally invalid as offending against the guarantees embodied inss. 7,9and12of theCharter, and proceeded to sentence the appellant to an indeterminate period of detention in a penitentiary.  8.The appellant's appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appeal Division, was unanimously dismissed for reasons given by Macdonald J.A. On January 31, 1985, leave to appeal to this Court was granted.  9.The following constitutional questions were stated by the Court on March 26, 1985:  1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Codeof Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the rights guaranteed by ss. 7, 9, 11 and/or 12 of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of theCriminal Code, in whole or in part, justified on the basis ofs. 1of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsand therefore not inconsistent with theConstitution Act, 1982?  10.The appellant also argued that his rights unders. 7of theCharterwere violated by the Crown's failure to give him notice, before his election of a mode of trial and the entry of his plea, that it intended to bring, or contemplated bringing, a \"dangerous offender\" application under Part XXI of theCode.  11.The Attorneys General of Canada, Ontario, British Columbia and Saskatchewan intervened in support of the constitutional validity of Part XXI.

        "Facts": " 3The relevant facts of this appeal are not in dispute.  The appellant is a woodsman and a labourer who lived with his mother in Belmont, Nova Scotia, near Truro.  At the time of the offence, he was 35 years old.  He had no prior criminal record.  He had a drinking problem from the age of 14 until his early 30s.  He stopped drinking when he entered a relationship with the victim’s sister, Anita Teed.  When they broke up, the appellant started drinking again.  4One such occasion was on May 14, 1996.  On that day, the appellant was drinking with his friend, Adrian Teed, and Mr. Teed’s father, Karl Staples, at the house of Mr. Teed’s mother, Essie.  The three men left the house together and travelled to the Teeds’ isolated camp in the woods.  There, the three continued to drink, and the appellant began taking prescription drugs, including Valium.  While Mr. Staples was inside the cabin, the appellant and Mr. Teed successfully cut off a length of a rifle barrel.  The appellant told Mr. Teed that the gun was to be used to commit a robbery, but alleges that, in fact, he had intended to kill himself with the weapon.  The appellant testified that he wanted to commit suicide as a result of severe depression from a recent breakup with Mr. Teed’s sister, Anita.  The trial judge accepted that, at the time, the appellant was quite distraught.  It was also accepted that he was very intoxicated.  5While Mr. Teed remained at the camp, the appellant drove Mr. Staples home.  Upon returning to the camp, the appellant found Mr. Teed lying in the top bunk in the cabin.  While holding the rifle which he knew to be loaded, the appellant jumped up to the lower bunk in order to shake Mr. Teed – either to awaken him, or to get his attention.  As might be expected in this state of intoxication, the appellant lost his footing while he jumped, and he fell.  The gun discharged, and the bullet struck Mr. Teed in the head, killing him instantly.  The gun was not susceptible to shock discharge.  There was no evidence that the appellant intended to aim the gun at the victim.  6The appellant dragged Mr. Teed’s body out of the cabin to a point in the woods approximately five kilometres away from the cabin, and covered it with a blanket.  The appellant then drove to Essie Teed’s house.  He pointed the gun at Mr. Teed’s mother, telling her to be quiet and to sit down.  He told her he had already killed one person that night.  Mrs. Teed calmed the appellant down, and took the rifle from him.  The appellant stated that he wanted to kill himself.  In order to calm the appellant down further, Mrs. Teed took the accused to see the victim’s sister, Anita Teed.  7After this meeting, Essie Teed returned the rifle to the appellant, and told him to not bring it around anymore.  The appellant disposed of the rifle in a river.  The following day, he allegedly attempted to commit suicide by setting the cabin on fire while remaining inside.  Forty-five minutes later, he admitted himself into the psychiatric ward of a local hospital, where he confessed to killing Mr. Teed.  The appellant has always been very remorseful.  At trial, the appellant pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death, contrary tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C‑46, and unlawfully pointing a firearm, contrary to s. 86 of theCode.  8Both Anita Teed and Essie Teed feared for their safety after the incident, and this formed the basis of the probation officer’s pre-sentencing report recommendation that community supervision would be inappropriate.  The appellant spent five months in pre-trial custody.  At his sentencing, the appellant challenged the constitutional validity of the minimum sentence imposed pursuant tos. 220(a) of theCriminal Code.  The trial judge found that the provision violateds. 12of theCharter, and sentenced the appellant to two years’ imprisonment for the criminal negligence charge (taking into account pre-trial custody), and one year consecutive for the unlawful pointing of a firearm charge.  The Crown appealed.  The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, and imposed a four-year sentence on the appellant, without any credit for pre-trial custody.

Mrs. Liversain apparently became aware of the trio's intentions and was severely beaten.  She died of her injuries and the appellant, Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes were all charged with second degree murder.  The Crown proceeded against the appellant first with the intention of using the other two as witnesses.  Although he had testified at the preliminary inquiry, Benoît Deschênes refused to testify at the appellant's trial.  The Crown then applied to the judge to have the transcript of Deschênes' testimony at the preliminary inquiry introduced as evidence at the appellant's jury trial unders. 643(1)of theCriminal Code.  The trial judge held that the requirements ofs. 643(1)of theCriminal Codehad been met and that the previously taken testimony should be admitted as evidence at the trial.  The appellant's defence was that Josée Thibault and Benoît Deschênes and not himself inflicted the fatal injuries on Mrs. Liversain.

        "Facts": " 6The appellant, Robert Latimer, farmed in Wilkie, Saskatchewan.  His 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, suffered a severe form of cerebral palsy.  She was quadriplegic and her physical condition rendered her immobile.  She was bedridden for much of the time.  Her condition was a permanent one, caused by neurological damage at the time of her birth.  Tracy was said to have the mental capacity of a four-month-old baby, and she could communicate only by means of facial expressions, laughter and crying.   She was completely dependent on others for her care.  Tracy suffered seizures despite the medication she took.  It was thought she experienced a great deal of pain, and the pain could not be reduced by medication since the pain medication conflicted with her anti-epileptic medication and her difficulty in swallowing.  Tracy experienced five to six seizures daily.   She had to be spoon-fed, and her lack of nutrients caused weight loss.  7There was evidence that Tracy could have been fed with a feeding tube into her stomach, an option that would have improved her nutrition and health, and that might also have allowed for more effective pain medication to be administered.  The Latimers rejected the feeding-tube option as being intrusive and as representing the first step on a path to preserving Tracy’s life artificially.  8Tracy had a serious disability, but she was not terminally ill.  Her doctors anticipated that she would have to undergo repeated surgeries, her breathing difficulties had increased, but her life was not in its final stages.  9Tracy enjoyed music, bonfires, being with her family and the circus.  She liked to play music on a radio, which she could use with a special button.  Tracy could apparently recognize family members and she would express joy at seeing them.  Tracy also loved being rocked gently by her parents.  10Tracy underwent numerous surgeries in her short lifetime.  In 1990, surgery tried to balance the muscles around her pelvis.  In 1992, it was used to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back.  11Like the majority of totally involved, quadriparetic children with cerebral palsy, Tracy had developed scoliosis, an abnormal curvature and rotation in the back, necessitating surgery to implant metal rods to support her spine.  While it was a successful procedure, further problems developed in Tracy’s right hip:  it became dislocated and caused her considerable pain.  12Tracy was scheduled to undergo further surgery on November 19, 1993.  This was to deal with her dislocated hip and, it was hoped, to lessen her constant pain.  The procedure involved removing her upper thigh bone, which would leave her lower leg loose without any connecting bone; it would be held in place only by muscle and tissue.  The anticipated recovery period for this surgery was one year.  13The Latimers were told that this procedure would cause pain, and the doctors involved suggested that further surgery would be required in the future to relieve the pain emanating from various joints in Tracy’s body.  According to the appellant’s wife, Laura Latimer, further surgery was perceived as mutilation.  As a result, Robert Latimer formed the view that his daughter’s life was not worth living.  14In the weeks leading up to Tracy’s death, the Latimers looked into the option of placing Tracy in a group home in North Battleford.  She had lived there between July and October of 1993, just prior to her death, while her mother was pregnant.  The Latimers applied to place Tracy in the home in October, but later concluded they were not interested in permanently placing her in that home at that time.  15On October 12, 1993, after learning that the doctors wished to perform this additional surgery, the appellant decided to take his daughter’s life.  On Sunday, October 24, 1993, while his wife and Tracy’s siblings were at church, Robert Latimer carried Tracy to his pickup truck, seated her in the cab, and inserted a hose from the truck’s exhaust pipe into the cab.  She died from the carbon monoxide.  16The police conducted an autopsy and discovered carbon monoxide in her blood.  The appellant at first maintained that Tracy simply passed away in her sleep.  He later confessed to having taken her life, and gave a statement to the investigating police and partially re-enacted his actions on videotape.  Mr. Latimer also told police that he had considered giving Tracy an overdose of Valium, or “shooting her in the head”.  17Mr. Latimer has been convicted of murder twice in this case.  He was initially charged with first degree murder and convicted by a jury of second degree murder.  The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan upheld his conviction and life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 10 years, with Bayda C.J.S. dissenting on the sentence:R. v. Latimer(1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (“Latimer (No. 1)”).  The case was then appealed to this Court:  [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217.  It turned out that the prosecutor had interfered with the jury selection process.  The Crown conceded that a new trial could not be avoided.  In the second trial, Mr. Latimer was again convicted of second degree murder, and it is from that conviction that this appeal arises.

        "Facts": " The appellant, Emerson Raymond Broyles was sixteen years old at the time of the alleged murder of his grandmother.  He had been living with his mother until she threw him out of the house in January or February of 1984.  Broyles then lived with a number of people, including his grandmother, Lorraine Briggs.  Briggs had a one bedroom basement suite in a house owned by an elderly man.  Briggs slept in a camperized van which she parked in the back of the house, and which she drove to work.  When Broyles stayed with her, he slept in an upstairs bedroom.  Briggs worked as a cook at the Edmonton Journal Cafeteria.  She started work at six in the morning, and was never late.  On June 26, 1984, Briggs did not show up for work.  Repeated phone calls to her home by her supervisor went unanswered.  On July 3, Briggs' body was found under the stairwell in her home, wrapped in green plastic garbage bags.  The body had begun to decompose.  The cause of death was asphyxia resulting from strangulation; two coils of thick rope were still wrapped tightly around her neck when she was found.  The body was dressed in a long sleeved sweater, a camisole and a nightie with a bra loosely arranged on the body but not in place.  The nightie had been pulled up and the thighs and genital area exposed but it was impossible to say if Briggs had been sexually molested.  A palm print was found on one of the garbage bags which was positively identified as being that of the accused Broyles.  In the expert opinion of an R.C.M.P. laser expert, the print was \"most likely placed on the bag at a time when there was an item in the bag\".  On July 4, Broyles was charged with two counts of forgery.  On July 6, he was charged with murder.  The only evidence implicating Broyles in the murder was circumstantial.  Broyles was seen driving his grandmother's van at seven or seven thirty on the morning of her disappearance.  He drove the van until his arrest on July 3.  Broyles made numerous inconsistent statements about the events surrounding his grandmother's disappearance.  Of particular importance on this appeal are statements made by Broyles to Todd Ritter.  Ritter was Broyles' friend.  He was asked by the police to visit Broyles wearing a body pack recording device.  Although Broyles did not admit to killing his grandmother to Ritter, he did admit that he knew she was dead the day she went missing.  Broyles added, \"[b]ut the cops don't know that I knew she was downstairs.  Only my [lawyer] knows that.  And now you do\".  Broyles was convicted at trial before a judge and jury of second degree murder.  He was given the minimum sentence of life in prison without eligibility for parole for ten years.  Broyles was advised of his right to counsel when he was first arrested for fraud on July 3.  At the station, Broyles asked to call a lawyer.  He was given a telephone and a telephone book, and left alone to make a telephone call.  Broyles was seen to punch numbers into the phone, but he did not appear to be talking.  Broyles was then questioned by Detective Anderson.  He was told that he was not obliged to say anything unless he wished to do so, but that anything he said might be given in evidence.  The interview lasted from 8:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. on July 3.  Detective Anderson identified himself as being from the Homicide Branch of the Edmonton City Police.  He did not tell Broyles that he was a suspect in the disappearance of the deceased Briggs.  The interview was brought to an abrupt end when Anderson was called out of the room to be informed that Briggs' body had been discovered.  Anderson began a second interview of Broyles at 11 p.m. on the same day.  Anderson testified that, at the beginning of the second interview, Broyles was not a suspect in a homicide.  Anderson added that at that time the police were not even sure that what they had was a homicide.  Anderson brought the interview to an end at 11:30 p.m. because he thought he would get nothing new from Broyles.  Anderson then processed the paper work for the forgery charges.  However, Broyles was not released because the \"investigation of the `suspicious death' was not concluded so they kept him in the holding area in case they wanted to talk to him again ....\"  Detective Stewart saw the body of the deceased that same night at 10:25 p.m.  He testified that he suspected that it was an unnatural death because of the way in which the body was found wrapped in plastic bags and entwined in ropes.  He returned to headquarters, where it was decided that he would interview Broyles.  Broyles was questioned by Stewart beginning at two in the morning on the same night.  He was again given the caution about not being required to say anything.  The interview was tape‑recorded.  There was some question whether Broyles had asked for a lawyer during this interview, but the trial judge ruled that the relevant part of the tape was inaudible.  Stewart testified that neither before nor after the interview was he prepared to charge Broyles with murder.  Broyles was questioned again shortly before three in the morning of the same night by a Detective Peters.  He was given the caution once again.  Peters had viewed the body between 10:30 p.m. and 1:10 a.m. of the same night.  He suspected foul play.  He suspected Broyles but did not have the basis to charge him.  The interview ended at 3:39 a.m. on July 4.  On July 6, Broyles was charged with murder.

        "Facts": " The two respondents, Sutcliffe Logan Jr. and Warren Leroy Johnson, together with two other co-accused, Hugh Logan (the brother of respondent Logan) and Clive Brown, were all charged with a number of offences arising from a series of robberies in the Toronto area.  This appeal pertains only to the charges against the two respondents for attempted murder which resulted from an incident during one of the robberies.  The facts surrounding the incident are as follows.  At around 11:00 p.m. on September 23, 1983, Hugh Logan, Clive Brown and the respondent Warren Johnson entered a convenience store, wearing masks and armed with revolvers.  Hugh Logan shot the lone clerk, Barbara Turnbull, in the neck, causing severe injuries.  The cash register was robbed and the men fled.  While awaiting trial on the charges, the respondents were held in protective custody in a jail in the Toronto area.  Shortly before the trial, the police received information from an informer that the respondent Sutcliffe Logan was boasting openly about his involvement in the planning of the robberies, including the one from which the attempted murder charges arose.  Two undercover police officers were placed in protective custody with the respondents, posing as two persons arrested on drug charges.  The officers struck up an acquaintance with the two respondents who made certain inculpatory statements.  The officers testified that they did not encourage the respondents to talk, but merely provided the opportunity for the making of the statements.  The officers made notes of the conversation immediately following the conversation during what they pretended was a visit from an articling student from their lawyer's office.  These statements were admitted into evidence at trial.  Also during the course of the trial, the respondent Warren Johnson took the stand and, while admitting that he was one of the robbers, testified that he had no intention to shoot anyone and that there had been no discussion concerning the use of guns.  In his charge to the jury with respect to the respondent Warren Johnson, the trial judge said that \"you may well have considerable doubt whether he knew or should have known that one of his group would probably shoot somebody with the intention to kill\".  With respect to the respondent Sutcliffe Logan, he stated that \"you would then have to consider whether he knew or should have known that one of the group would probably, in the course of the robbery, shoot someone with intent to kill\".  In his explanation of s. 21 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, the trial judge instructed the jury that \"[i]t must be established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew or ought to have known that someone would probably shoot with the intention of killing\".  Hugh Logan was found by the jury to have been the one who shot the victim.  The respondents were convicted by the jury of a number offences including the attempted murder of Barbara Turnbull.  The respondents appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.  The Court of Appeal allowed their appeals with respect to the convictions for attempted murder, and substituted convictions for armed robbery in their stead. The only issue before this Court is the constitutionality ofs. 21(2)of theCriminal Code. "

        "Facts": " The appellant, Lewis Anthony Wiggins, was the owner of a vessel, theBeaufort Spirit, which the Crown alleged was used by him in the execution of a scheme for the importation of narcotics into Canada.  Evidence at trial showed that the appellant had contacted a person by the name of Mr. Seed, who, unknown to the appellant, was a police informer, and asked him if he would like to invest in the scheme.  The informer told police about this conversation and, at their request, had further conversations with the appellant while wearing a \"body pack\", i.e., an electromagnetic transmitter, which transmitted the conversations to the police who simultaneously recorded them.  The informer was given \"seed money\" by the police which he, in turn, gave to the appellant as an \"investment\" in the scheme.  In one taped conversation, the appellant told the informer how the narcotics were obtained, that they were welded into the hull of the vessel, and how they were transported and hidden upon his reaching British Columbia.  The police conducted searches of the appellant's vessel but found no narcotics and no evidence to support the appellant's detailed account of how the narcotics had been hidden in British Columbia.  At the conclusion of the trial, counsel for the appellant explained to the jury the defence theory that the appellant was lying to the informer about the narcotics being welded into the hull of the vessel and about the manner in which it had been hidden.  The appellant did not testify.  The trial judge gave his charge to the jury on the same day the defence made its submissions.  He indicated that he would not repeat the theories of the parties as they had been well covered by the parties' counsel.  The appellant was convicted of conspiring to import a narcotic contrary to s. 423(1)(d) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  The appellant then appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.  He first sought to introduce fresh evidence, but this request was refused on the basis of the principles enunciated inPalmer and Palmer v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759.  The appellant's various grounds of appeal were similarly rejected.  The first -‑ that the trial judge erred in failing to put the theory of the defence to the jury -‑ failed because the court found this to be one of those rare cases recognized inAzoulay v. The Queen, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, where it was not necessary for the judge to do so.  The second issue -‑ whether the trial judge erred in admitting the appellant's passport into evidence on the ground that a passport deposited with the police under the terms of his judicial interim release does not become available as evidence -‑ was disposed of on the simple ground that it was too late to raise the objection.  The third ground of appeal was that the appellant's privacy was invaded by the recording of his conversations with the informer.  The court cited with approval the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Sanelli(1987), 60 C.R. (3d) 142, in which it was held that s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Codedid not contravenes. 8of theCharterand that there was no \"reasonable expectation of privacy in the course of a conversation where one party to it has consented to it being intercepted and recorded\".  The court noted that the law does not require that \"when the police are aware that someone is about to divulge a private matter to another they must seek judicial authorization before that other person may listen to what is said or secretly record what is said\".  The court also rejected this ground of appeal.  On the appeal to this Court, the same issues were raised but the appellant in addition argued that the Crown had suppressed evidence of the vessel's stability information booklet which, it was alleged, would support the appellant's case.

        "Facts": " 5.On September 9, 1983, Constable Bisceglia was the officer in charge of the Drug Section of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) Detachment in Campbell River, British Columbia. That day, a confidential source told him that the appellant had a quantity of marijuana at his apartment. Two other sources had given Constable Bisceglia the same tip within the previous few days. Early in the afternoon, Constable Bisceglia appeared before a justice of the peace and applied under s. 10 of theNarcotic Control Actfor a warrant to search a dwelling for narcotics. The justice of the peace issued the search warrant. In compliance with s. 10(2) of the Act, the warrant named Constables Bisceglia, Arseneault, Clark, and Underhill, all of the R.C.M.P., as the peace officers authorized to enter and search the dwelling. The warrant was valid between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. of that day.  6.The officers went to the appellant's apartment at 4:00 p.m. but no‑one was home. They did not attempt to enter but went about other duties. At approximately 6:00 p.m., Constable Arseneault learned that the appellant was at home, but was leaving shortly for Vancouver, and would not be back for two or three days. Constable Bisceglia decided to execute the warrant immediately, but Constables Clark and Underhill were about to go off duty. Constable Bisceglia telephoned the justice of the peace who had issued the search warrant, explained the circumstances, and asked if it would be possible to substitute two other officers. The justice of the peace authorized the substitution and the officers went to the appellant's apartment, arriving there around 6:20 p.m. All four were dressed in civilian clothes.  7.The police officers knocked on the door. The appellant answered. Two other men were in the apartment, in the living room. Constable Bisceglia gave the appellant a copy of the search warrant, showed his identification, and arrested the appellant for possession of marijuana. He then read the standard police warning, including the right to counsel guaranteed by theCharter. The appellant immediately picked up the phone and said he was going to call his lawyer, but Constable Bisceglia told him that he could not telephone until the police had \"matters under control.\" Constable Bisceglia then asked the appellant for his full name, address and age, and for some identification. He also asked the appellant some questions concerning his marijuana usage. Constable Bisceglia then asked the other two men for their names. Approximately forty minutes after the police entered the apartment, the two men left. While Constable Bisceglia interviewed the appellant and the two men, the other officers searched the apartment. After the two men left, Constable Bisceglia assisted in the search. Constable Vanschaik and Corpo­ral McBratney, the two substituted officers, did not seize items they discovered in the search, but pointed them out to Constables Bisceglia and Arseneault to seize. Constables Bisceglia and Arseneault together seized about 300 grams of \"green plant‑like material,\" a set of scales, plastic bags, a \"hook up\" [sic] pipe, and a \"huge number\" of bills totalling $3,193. After the conclusion of the search, the police took the accused to the police station, arriving there around 8:00 p.m. He was then allowed to telephone his lawyer.  8.At thevoir direon the admission of the evidence, Constable Bisceglia was asked to explain what he had meant when he told the appellant that he could not telephone his lawyer until the officers had matters under control. Constable Bisceglia explained that he wanted to find out who were the two additional occupants of the apartment. He was also aware that the appellant had two restricted firearms at the apartment, for which the appellant had the appropriate registration certificates. Constable Bisceglia explained that he wanted to locate the two revolvers.  9.After his initial attempt to contact counsel, the appellant made no further request to use the telephone. The police officers did not advise him again of his right to retain counsel after the initial warnings.  III "

        "Facts": " 44While the appellant was not subjected to a body “cavity” search, the search conducted went far beyond the typical “frisk” search which usually accompanies an arrest.  Sergeant Kennedy passed his gloved hand through the appellant’s hair to remove some hair, combed some more out, and clipped and pulled out still more.  The appellant was then made to pull hair from his own pubic area.  A dentist was called in to take the appellant’s teeth impressions and buccal swabs.  All this was without the appellant’s consent and despite his protests.  The dental procedure involved the placing of several instruments and various substances into the appellant’s mouth.  As well, photographs and a video were taken of his mouth.  The whole procedure took two hours.  45Counsel for the respondent argued that the taking of dental impressions was analogous to the routine practice of fingerprinting.  The case ofR. v. Beare, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, was cited as support for the proposition that the common law allowed for the use of such identification procedures upon arrest.  In that case, La Forest J. noted that the reduced privacy expectation upon arrest justifies the fingerprinting.  However, he added this important qualification at p. 413:  While some may find [fingerprinting] distasteful, it is insubstantial, of very short duration, and leaves no lasting impression.  There is no penetration into the body and no substance is removed from it.  46How very different is the making of dental impressions.  It is a lengthy and highly intrusive process.  Further, the taking of the scalp and pubic hair samples involved the forceful removal of hair from the body over the specific objections of the accused.  Significantly, inR. v. Borden, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, it was found that where there is no statutory authorization for the seizure of bodily samples, consent must be obtained if the seizure is to be lawful.  Here the police knew they were dealing with a young offender. They were aware that theYoung Offenders Actrequired that a parent or counsel should be present when a suspected young offender was being interviewed.  Nonetheless, in the absence of any adult counsellor and contrary to the specific instruction of his lawyers, the police interviewed the appellant at length and by threat of force took bodily samples and dental impressions.  This was the abusive exercise of raw physical authority by the police.  47No matter what may be the pressing temptations to obtain evidence from a person the police believe to be guilty of a terrible crime, and no matter what the past frustrations to their investigations, the police authority to search as an incident to arrest should not be exceeded.  Any other conclusion could all too easily lead to police abuses in the name of the good of society as perceived by the officers.  When they are carrying out their duties as highly respected and admired agents of the state they must respect the dignity and bodily integrity of all who are arrested.  The treatment meted out by agents of the state to even the least deserving individual will often indicate the treatment that all citizens of the state may ultimately expect.  Appropriate limits to the power of search incidental to arrest must be accepted and respected.  48The power to search and seize incidental to arrest was a pragmatic extension to the power of arrest.  Obviously the police must be able to protect themselves from attack by the accused who has weapons concealed on his person or close at hand.  The police must be able to collect and preserve evidence located at the site of the arrest or in a nearby motor vehicle.  As Rice J.A. put it in his dissenting reasons (at p. 360 N.B.R.):  The power to search and seize incidental to an arrest is predicated on pragmatic and exigent considerations inherent to the circumstances of an arrest.  49The common law power cannot be so broad as to empower police officers to seize bodily samples.  They are usually in no danger of disappearing.  Here, there was no likelihood that the appellant’s teeth impressions would change, nor that his hair follicles would present a different DNA profile with the passage of time.  There was simply no possibility of the evidence sought being destroyed if it was not seized immediately.  It should be remembered that one of the limitations to the common law power articulated inCloutier v. Langlois,supra, was the discretionary aspect of the power and that it should not be abusive.  The common law power of search incidental to arrest cannot be so broad as to encompass the seizure without valid statutory authority of bodily samples in the face of a refusal to provide them.  If it is, then the common law rule itself is unreasonable, since it is too broad and fails to properly balance the competing rights involved.  50It is clear that the appellant’s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure was very seriously violated.  Since the search and seizure of the bodily samples was not authorized by either statutory or common law it could not have been reasonable. It is thus unnecessary to consider either the reasonableness of the law or the manner in which the search was conducted.  (b)Did the Taking of the Hair Samples, Teeth Impressions and Buccal Swabs Contravene Section 7 of theCharter?  51The taking of the dental impressions, hair samples and buccal swabs from the accused also contravened the appellant’ss. 7Charterright to security of the person.  The taking of the bodily samples was highly intrusive.  It violated the sanctity of the body which is essential to the maintenance of human dignity.  It was the ultimate invasion of the appellant’s privacy.  SeePohoretsky,supra.  InDyment,supra, at pp. 431‑32, La Forest J. emphasized that “the use of a person’s body without his consent to obtain information about him, invades an area of personal privacy essential to the maintenance of his human dignity”.  Quite simply, the taking of the samples without authorization violated the appellant’s right to security of his person and contravened the principles of fundamental justice.

        "Facts": " [48]Indeed, the sentencing regime under Canadian law must be implemented within, and not apart from, the framework of theCharter.  Sentencing decisions are always subject to constitutional scrutiny.  A sentence cannot be “fit” if it does not respect the fundamental values enshrined in theCharter.  Thus, incidents alleged to constitute aCharterviolation can be considered in sentencing, provided that they bear the necessary connection to the sentencing exercise.  As mitigating factors, the circumstances of the breach would have to align with the circumstances of the offence or the offender, as required by s. 718.2 of theCode.  Naturally, the more egregious the breach, the more attention the court will likely pay to it in determining a fit sentence.  [49]This is consistent with the communicative function of sentencing. A proportionate sentence is one that expresses, to some extent, society’s legitimate shared values and concerns.  As Lamer C.J. stated inM. (C.A.):  Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by theCriminal Code. [para. 81]  A sentence that takes account of aCharterviolation is therefore able to communicate respect for the shared set of values expressed in theCharter.  In the words of Professor Allan Manson:  The communicative function of sentencing is all about conveying messages.  The messages are directed to the community.  They are about the values which ought to be important to the community. (“CharterViolations in Mitigation of Sentence” (1995), 41 C.R. (4th) 318, at p. 323)  Indeed,s. 718of theCriminal Codedescribes the fundamental purpose of sentencing as that of contributing to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society”.  This function must be understood as providing scope for sentencing judges to consider not only the actions of the offender, but also those of state actors.  Provided that the impugned conduct relates to the individual offender and the circumstances of his or her offence, the sentencing process includes consideration of society’s collective interest in ensuring that law enforcement agents respect the rule of law and the shared values of our society.  [50]The conclusion that the circumstances of allegedCharterbreaches can be considered during sentencing, when they are relevant to the offender and to the offence, is consistent with much of the sentencing jurisprudence.  In several cases, courts have reduced a sentence to reflect the prejudice caused to the accused by the incident giving rise to aCharterviolation, without invoking s. 24(1).  For instance, inR. v. Munoz, 2006 ABQB 901, 69 Alta. L.R. (4th) 231, an offender’s overall sentence was reduced to take account of the breach of his s. 7 and s. 12 rights by police guards.  While awaiting trial for serious offences including robbery and aggravated assault, the accused was subject to acts of physical violence by the guards and was forced to wear a degrading prisoner uniform called a “baby doll”.  Writing for the court, Wilkins J. described the accused’s treatment at the hands of the police as “grossly disproportionate to the punishment that was appropriate” (para. 77).  He held that a fit sentence, notwithstanding theCharterbreaches, would have been seven years’ imprisonment, on the high end of the scale for those particular offences.  Taking the breaches into account, and after ordering an enhanced credit of 33 months for time served in the remand facility, he ordered a sentence of two years less a day in jail.  The court did not cites. 24(1)of theCharteras authority for the sentence reduction.  [51]Perhaps more instructive to the current appeal isR. v. Pigeon(1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (B.C.C.A.), which illustrates the court’s authority to address police violence within the context of ordinary sentencing principles.  The offender was a Chilcotin man who had fled from police after committing a break and enter.  After an officer fired a shot into the air, Mr. Pigeon returned from whence he had fled — unarmed and unaggressive — with the intent to surrender.  The officer grabbed Mr. Pigeon by the hair and threw him onto the pavement.  Rather than handcuff the accused at this point, the officer lifted him back up and dragged him by the hair to where the other officer was stationed.  He threw him onto the ground again and, with the other officer’s foot firmly placed on the accused’s neck, handcuffed him.  Mr. Pigeon did not resist arrest or attempt to escape at any time.  [52]The accused was convicted and sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment followed by 18 months’ probation.  The trial judge acknowledged the injuries suffered by Mr. Pigeon during his arrest, but concluded that the officer’s use of force was irrelevant to the offender’s sentence:  Although you deserve some sympathy on account of that ill treatment, it is not a factor that I am prepared to take into consideration.  You have a civil remedy.  After releasing those reasons, the trial judge filed a formal report to the Court of Appeal recommending a reduced sentence of six months’ imprisonment.  He wrote: I refused to take into account the assaults that the accused had suffered at the hands of the police, and told him that he had a civil remedy for that.  On reflection I am of the view that effect ought to have been given to the assaults. Had I considered it appropriate to do so I would have further reduced the term of imprisonment by three months to six months.  . . .  I am respectfully of the view that it is not in the public interest that police constables should be perceived as “getting away” [with] ill treating aboriginal people, and I am no longer of the view that a civil remedy is the proper form of redress.  On appeal, Carrothers J.A. accepted the trial judge’s findings that the degree of force used by police was unwarranted and excessive.  He noted that, although the court is “not sitting in judgment of the police”, it is within the ambit of the appellate court’s review of the fitness of the sentence to consider all that is known about the offender and the offence, along with the “realities and complexion of the community . . . which are relevant to and bear upon the public perception of justice” (p. 343).  In light of these considerations, Carrothers J.A. ordered a reduced sentence of six months’ imprisonment, falling to the low end of the scale of sentences for similar offences.  [53]It is important to note that a sentence can be reduced in light of state misconduct even when the incidents complained of do not rise to the level of aCharterbreach.  InPigeon, the court did not need to determine whether the accused’s s. 7 rights had been violated, as there was sufficient scope within the regular sentencing process to address the impropriety of the police officers’ actions.  Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal held inR. v. Bosley(1992), 18 C.R. (4th) 347, that the trial judge had properly considered excessive but not unconstitutional delay as a mitigating factor in his determination of a fit sentence (see alsoR. v. Leaver(1996), 3 C.R. (5th) 138 (Ont. C.A.)).  And inR. v. Panousis, 2002 ABQB 1109, 329 A.R. 47, the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench treated the delay in the proceedings as a relevant mitigating factor that led to a reduced sentence for the offence of trafficking in cocaine.  Although the delay did not amount to a s. 11(b) violation, the court held that it had caused prejudice to the accused that was relevant and probative to the sentencing process.  The majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, in brief oral reasons (2004 ABCA 211 (CanLII)), reversed the trial judge’s decision and imposed a sentence of incarceration of two years less a day and a heavy fine.  The majority did not state whether it disagreed with the trial judge’s finding that delay was a relevant mitigating circumstance, but it is notable that its final sentence went below the trial judge’s appreciation of the usual sentences for serious drug offences.  [54]To be certain, the concept of recognizing harm or prejudice caused to the offender as a mitigating circumstance upon sentencing did not originate with theCharter.  In the pre-Chartercase ofR. v. Kirzner(1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 665, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence for drug offences to reflect the police force’s role in exposing the offender to the opportunity to commit the offences for which he was convicted.  The RCMP had used the offender, who was addicted to heroin, as an informer to infiltrate and gain information about the drug trade in Montreal.  The court found that, although the defence of entrapment was not available to the accused, the police were sufficiently implicated in the offender’s actions to warrant a reduction of his sentence.  Likewise, the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence in the pre-Chartercontext to mitigate the effects of an unlawful search of the accused’s premises inR. v. Steinberg, [1967] 1 O.R. 733.  Excessive delay attributable to the prosecution or police has also been considered a mitigating factor in a number of pre-Chartercases (R. v. Cooper (No. 2)(1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 35 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Simon(1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 159 (Ont. C.A.)).  Likewise, delay arising out of strategically delayed charges in respect of contemporaneous offences has led to reduction of the sentences (R. v. Parisien(1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (B.C.C.A.);R. v. Burke, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 124 (Ont. C.A.);R. v. Fairn(1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 423 (N.S. Co. Ct.)).  [55]Thus, a sentencing judge may take into account police violence or other state misconduct while crafting a fit and proportionate sentence, without requiring the offender to prove that the incidents complained of amount to aCharterbreach.  Provided the interests at stake can properly be considered by the court while acting within the sentencing regime in theCriminal Code, there is simply no need to turn to theCharterfor a remedy.  However, if aCharterbreach has already been alleged and established, a trial judge should not be prevented from reducing the sentence accordingly, so long as the incidents giving rise to the breach are relevant to the usual sentencing regime.  Of course, as we shall see, as a general rule, a court cannot reduce a sentence below a mandatory minimum or order a reduced sentence that is not provided for by statute.  That said, circumstances of aCharterbreach or other instances of state misconduct, in exceptional circumstances, do allow a court to derogate from the usual rules to which its decisions are subject.

However, he testified that while he got out of the police car and approached the vehicle, he saw the appellant gesturing as if putting it in reverse and, in effect, the vehicle moved back about one foot.  The key was in the ignition and the ignition was on.  The passenger was found in possession of an additional set of keys in his pocket.  The appellant and the passenger were immediately arrested by the police.  It is common ground that the accused had been drinking heavily in the hours which preceded his arrest.  He testified that he had no recollection of any of the events that took place between midnight and the moment he was awakened in his cell, late that morning.  The appellant was acquitted of the four counts of which he was charged: robbery contrary to s. 303 of theCode, theft of the car contrary to s. 294(a) of theCode, possession of the car contrary to s. 312(1)(a) of theCodeand care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 234 of theCode.  The Crown has only appealed the acquittal on the s. 234 charge, that is,  having care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired.

        "Facts": " 38This Court has often stressed the importance of a factual basis inChartercases. See, for example,MacKay v. Manitoba, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at p. 361;R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713, at pp. 762 and 767-68,perDickson C.J.;Rio Hotel Ltd. v. New Brunswick (Liquor Licensing Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 59, at p. 83;Danson v. Ontario (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099;Baron v. Canada, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 416, at p. 452;DeSousa,supra, at p. 954;Canadian Broadcasting Corp.  v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 480, at para. 15. These facts have been broken into two categories: legislative and adjudicative.  InDanson,supra, at p. 1099, Sopinka J., for the Court, outlined these categories as follows:  These terms derive from Davis,Administrative Law Treatise(1958), vol. 2, para. 15.03, p. 353. (See also Morgan, \"Proof of Facts in Charter Litigation\", in Sharpe, ed.,Charter Litigation(1987).) Adjudicative facts are those that concern the immediate parties: in Davis' words, \"who did what, where, when, how, and with what motive or intent ....\" Such facts are specific, and must be proved by admissible evidence. Legislative facts are those that establish the purpose and background of legislation, including its social, economic and cultural context. Such facts are of a more general nature, and are subject to less stringent admissibility requirements: see e.g.,Re Anti-Inflation Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373,perLaskin C.J., at p. 391;Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 714,perDickson J. (as he then was), at p. 723; andReference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297,perMcIntyre J., at p. 318.   39The argument that the present appeal is premature rests on the contention that there are few adjudicative facts before the Court. Two points may be made in response.  40First, it is not clear what further adjudicative facts would arise if the respondent had gone through the impugned procedure and been refused production. Although, pursuant tos. 278.8(1)of theCriminal Code,  the trial judge must provide reasons for refusing to order production of any record, or part of any record, presumably these reasons could not divulge much about the content of the records in question for that would defeat the very purpose of the new provisions.  41Second, the record contains sufficient facts to resolve the issues posed by the present appeal. Indeed, no argument was made that the adjudicative facts, sparse as they may be, are insufficient.  Moreover, a determination that the legislation at issue in this appeal is unconstitutional in its general effect involves an assessment of the effects of the legislation under reasonable hypothetical circumstances.  InR. v. Goltz, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, Gonthier J. stated, for the majority, at pp. 515-16: "

        ],
        "Facts": " 2The appellant, Crawford, and his co-accused, Creighton, were charged with second degree murder of Behnke.  One night in early November 1988, Crawford and Creighton, who are distant cousins, went out drinking at a Belleville bar where they met and befriended the deceased, who was impaired.  The three men left the bar together, all appearing to witnesses to be drunk, and the deceased was robbed and beaten with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber.  The autopsy of the victim revealed that the immediate cause of death was a \"massive area of bruising\" within the victim's brain, consistent with the application of \"massive blunt force\" to the top of his head, but the pathologist did not rule out interplay between head injuries and serious injuries to other parts of his body.  The cause of death thus was stated to be multiple trauma to the head and body.  3The Crown's theory was that Crawford and Creighton pretended to befriend the impaired deceased, invited him to a party with the intention of robbing him, and after robbing him, either Crawford or Creighton or both beat the deceased viciously with a 2 x 4 causing his death.  4Crawford made no statement to the police.  He testified at trial, 13 months after the murder, that he had never struck the deceased and denied that he had aided or abetted in the assault.  Crawford testified that, on leaving the bar with Creighton and the deceased, the deceased had grabbed the waitress's leg and apologized and Creighton had told the waitress that he would \"take care of it\".  On the way to the party, Creighton hit the deceased without warning and the two exchanged about four punches before Crawford could intervene.  He tried to grab the deceased but lost his balance and he and the deceased fell to the ground with the deceased on top.  They began to scuffle when Creighton hit the deceased on the back with a 2 x 4.  Crawford became scared, shoved the deceased off him, and ran away.  When Creighton caught up to him, Creighton said \"I think I killed him\".  5Creighton's counsel cross-examined Crawford on Crawford's failure to make any statements to the police:    Q.Mr. Crawford, if my memory is correct the incident that brings us here today happened one year and 20 days ago; is that right?  A.I think so, yes.  I'm not too sure, I didn't check.  Q.Well, it's the 22nd day of November today, 1989?  A.Yes.  Q.Do you agree with that?  A.Yes.  Q.So this incident happened one year and 20 days ago?  A.Yes.  Q.You have had one year and 20 days to think about what you were going to tell us about this?  A.Just the truth.  Q.You've had one year and 20 days to think about it.  A.Just the truth.  Q.Have you ever told the police anything about it?  A.No.  Q.Have you ever told anybody in authority anything about it?  A.Just my lawyer.  Q.You have been well represented by counsel?  A.Yes.  Q.You were aware through your counsel what all the evidence was in this case?  A.Well, yes.  6Creighton did not testify at trial.  His version of the events was set out in a videotaped statement to the police on his arrest.  Creighton said that he, Crawford, and the victim had left the pub on the way to a party.  Crawford and the victim were arguing as they walked.  When a fight broke out between Crawford and the deceased, Creighton intervened and tried to break it up.  When that failed, since the deceased was on top of Crawford, he hit the deceased across the back about four times with a 2 x 4 piece of lumber (about 3 feet long).  Crawford continued to beat the victim with his fists, despite Creighton grabbing Crawford and telling him to stop since the victim was already hurt.  Unable to break up the fight, he climbed over a fence and left the scene.  At the point that he left, Creighton told the police that the deceased was still alive.  Crawford soon came running behind him saying that they had to \"get . . . out of here I think I killed him\".  7Effectively, each accused cast the blame primarily, if not entirely, upon the other, and each relied upon the defence of intoxication as negativing the intent for murder.  At trial, Creighton's counsel made much of the fact that Crawford had declined to give a statement to the police on his arrest, contrasting unfavourably with Creighton's full statement to the police at the earliest opportunity.   Conversely, Crawford's counsel, when addressing the jury, stated that \"an innocent man sitting in Creighton's seat would have gotten into that witness box and sworn that he was not guilty\".  Crawford's counsel also dealt with Creighton's counsel's cross-examination of Crawford in his closing address to the jury.  8On November 28, 1989, the appellant and co-accused were both convicted of second degree murder by White J. of the Ontario Supreme Court sitting with a jury.  They appealed their convictions to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  Crawford claimed that: (1)the trial judge erred in allowing counsel for the co-accused to cross-examine him on his failure to give a statement to the police, thus infringing his right to remain silent; and  (2)the trial judge had erred in not instructing the jury to disregard that cross-examination on his pre-trial silence.  On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals:  (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 130, 62 O.A.C. 91, 80 C.C.C. (3d) 421, 20 C.R. (4th) 331, 14 C.R.R. (2d) 93.  Weiler J.A. dissented, holding that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as to the use that it could make of the evidence that Crawford had not given a statement to police, in light of his constitutionally guaranteed right to remain silent, and would have allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial.

        "Facts": " 29The appellant argues that this Court inMoralesandPearsonemphasized the first two grounds for bail denial, suggesting that other grounds must be seen as suspect.  However,Morales,supra, made clear that the grounds for bail denial are not frozen.  Indeed, such a suggestion runs counter to common sense and law.  Parliament may make any law for bail denial it wishes, provided the law meets the constitutional requirements  of theCharter.  30Bail denial to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is not a mere  “catch-all” for cases where the first two grounds have failed.  It represents a separate and distinct basis for bail denial not covered by the other two categories.  The same facts may be relevant to all three heads.  For example, an accused’s implication in a terrorist ring or organized drug trafficking might be relevant to whether he is likely to appear at trial, whether he is likely to commit further offences or interfere with the administration of justice, and whether his detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the justice system.  But that does not negate the distinctiveness of the three grounds.  31I conclude that a provision that allows bail to be denied on the basis that the accused’s detention is required to maintain confidence in the administration of justice is neither superfluous nor unjustified.  It serves a very real need to permit a bail judge to detain an accused pending trial for the purpose of maintaining the public’s confidence if the circumstances of the case so warrant.  Without public confidence, the bail system and the justice system generally stand compromised.  While the circumstances in which recourse to this ground for bail denial may not arise frequently, when they do it is essential that a means of denying bail be available.

The extent to which it becomes a necessary adjunct to the right to make full answer and defence depends on the context.  The Garofoli threshold test requires that the defence show a reasonable likelihood that cross-examination of the affiant will elicit testimony of probative value to the issue for consideration by the reviewing judge.  It is grounded in two basic principles of evidence:  relevance and materiality.  It is also born out of concerns about the prolixity of proceedings and, in many cases, the need to protect the identity of informants.  The rule does not infringe the right to make full answer and defence.  There is no constitutional right to adduce irrelevant or immaterial evidence. Further, the leave requirement strikes an appropriate balance between the entitlement to cross-examination as an aspect of the right to make full answer and defence, and the public interest in the fair, but efficient, use of judicial resources and the timely determination of criminal proceedings.",

C-46 ),  was consonant with the rights guaranteed by s. 8  of the Charter .  However, the Court held that the interception of private communications by the state, with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof but without prior judicial authorization, infringed s. 8.  In response to Duarte, s. 184.2 was enacted permitting the interception of private communications with the consent of a participant under judicial authorization.  As will be discussed later, the authorization in this case was obtained under s. 184.2.  The appellants challenged the constitutionality of s. 184.2 at trial; the trial judge rejected their argument and his ruling was not challenged on appeal.",

            "3.1.1    Have the 1993 Criminal Code Amendments Changed the Legal Landscape?",
            "12                               First, the appellants contend that the current regime under Part VI of the Criminal Code  is “quite different” from the statutory scheme that was in place when Garofoli was decided.  Under the previous statutory scheme, the general rule in respect of wiretap evidence was exclusionary.  The evidence was inadmissible unless the Crown could bring it within one of the statutory exceptions and show that “the interception was lawfully made”.  Hence, if the wiretap did not meet the statutory preconditions, the evidence could not be admitted against the accused.  Under the present regime, it is the accused who bears the burden on a s. 24  Charter  application of  proving that his rights were violated and the remedy, rather than being an automatic exclusion, is left to be determined under s. 24(2)  of the Charter .  The appellants argue that the repeal of the former exclusionary rule has effectively shifted the onus in relation to the admissibility of wiretap evidence from the Crown to the accused.  Hence they submit that under the current statutory scheme, where the accused bears the onus of proof, it is inconsistent with the right to make full answer and defence that the accused also bear an evidentiary burden to demonstrate that the cross-examination of the affiant on the supporting affidavit is necessary.",
            "14                               The repeal of the “lawful interception” statutory precondition to the admissibility of the intercepted communications removed the need for the Crown to prove two of the three matters which had been the subject of the Parsons voir dire:  the facial validity of the authorization, and whether it had been implemented in accordance with its terms (see Garofoli, p. 1445).  (The obligation to prove reasonable notice of the intention to introduce the evidence remains by virtue of s. 189(5)  of the Criminal Code .)",
            "15                               Insofar as the facial validity of the authorization is concerned, the 1993  amendments have no real practical effect on the accused’s onus.  The first question to be determined on a Charter  challenge is whether the search is authorized by law.  In order to answer this question, the reviewing judge must determine whether the Criminal Code  provisions have been satisfied.  While the accused bears the onus of proving the alleged Charter  violation, in answer to the accused’s challenge, the evidentiary burden of producing a facially valid authorization will inevitably remain on the Crown, failing which the accused will have met his persuasive burden on this point with ease.",
            "19                               I therefore conclude that the appellants’ contention that the 1993 amendments to the Criminal Code  had “a significant and lasting impact on the ability of accused persons to challenge the sub-facial validity of wiretap authorizations” cannot be accepted.",
            "20                               Second, the appellants contend that the ex parte and in camera wiretap authorization process lacks sufficient procedural safeguards and that the procedure in Part VI of the Criminal Code  (containing the provisions on invasion of privacy) does not strike the appropriate balance between the individual’s privacy interest and the public’s interest in crime detection.  Hence, they submit that allowing an applicant to cross-examine, as a matter of right, the deponent of an affidavit filed in support of the wiretap authorization would provide a further counterbalance and enhance the appearance of fairness.",
            "24                               There is no debate that these important principles are relevant both in the formulation of an appropriate standard for allowing cross-examination and in its application.  However, the accused’s right to an evidentiary hearing must be considered in context.  It must also be balanced against countervailing interests, including the need to ensure that the criminal trial process is not plagued by lengthy proceedings that do not assist in the determination of the relevant issues.  As I will explain, the appellants’ argument ignores important contextual factors.  When the proposed cross-examination of an affiant is considered in the context of the review hearing and its narrow scope, it is my view that the Garofoli leave requirement strikes an appropriate balance between these competing interests.",
            "25                               The first contextual factor that is ignored by the appellants’ argument has already been mentioned — the right to full disclosure.  Under s. 187(1.4)  of the Criminal Code , the defence has access to all the documents relating to the authorization.  Access is granted on the simple assertion that the admissibility of the evidence is challenged and that access to the material is required in preparation for trial:  Dersch v. Canada (Attorney General), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1505, at p. 1517.  The material includes the affidavit filed in support of the application for an authorization.  Subject to any necessary editing for the protection of informants, the affidavit will usually provide a comprehensive account of the investigation leading up to the wiretap application, an articulation of the grounds relied upon in support of the application, and information relevant to the reasonable believability of material gathered from informants.  The affidavit filed in this case will be reviewed in detail later in these reasons.",
            "The Supreme Court of Canada and appellate courts across Canada have been attempting in recent years to restrict the issues that go to a jury to those which have, on the evidence, an air of reality to them.  Just as we have tried to restrict the trial of an accused on the merits to factual issues that are directly raised in the particular case, so should we strive to restrict pre-trial Charter  motions to matters of substance where defence counsel can establish some basis for a violation of a right.  Unless we, as courts, can find some method of rescuing our criminal trial process from the almost Dickensian procedural morass that it is now bogged down in, the public will lose patience with our traditional adversarial system of justice.  As Jonathan Swift might have said, we are presently sacrificing justice on the shrine of process. [p. 440]",
            "37                               Finally, as aptly argued by the intervener the Attorney General of British Columbia, a requirement that the defence meet a threshold test of some sort before engaging in cross-examination, pursuing a specific line of inquiry, or eliciting evidence in support of a full answer and defence is not an anomaly within the criminal justice system.  To state but a few examples:  hearsay evidence, although sought to be elicited by the defence, must meet the requirements of necessity and reliability; proposed expert evidence must meet the criteria set out in R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; access to or cross-examination on matters protected by solicitor-client privilege must meet the requirements of the “innocence at stake” exception; cross-examination on a complainant’s sexual history is prohibited unless it meets the test under s. 276(1)  of the Criminal Code ; third-party records in respect of certain offences listed under s. 278.2 must be shown to be likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify before they will be produced; defences must have an “air of reality” to them before they are put to the jury.  In this case, the defence must simply make a show of likely relevance on a material issue before the court.",
            "In short, the appellant showed a basis for the view that the cross-examination would elicit testimony tending to discredit the existence of one of the pre-conditions to the authorization, namely the investigative necessity requirement. Investigative necessity is a stringent requirement, requiring demonstration that there is, “practically speaking, no other reasonable alternative method of investigation, in the circumstances of the particular criminal inquiry” (emphasis in original):  R. v. Araujo (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), at para. 29.  There was a basis for believing that this exacting standard had not been met.  The same might be said here of the use of the undercover officers and police agents. [para. 14]",
            "49                               The appellants were charged with a number of drug-related offences.  In essence, the Crown alleged that they distributed cocaine to doormen and bartenders at various bars and clubs in downtown Vancouver.  The appellants were targeted by the police when Robert Molsberry, a self-admitted drug dealer and petty criminal who had been a doorman at a Vancouver club, complained to members of the Vancouver Police that the appellants and others were after him over unpaid drug debts and that he feared for his safety.  Molsberry agreed to “wear a wire” and act as police agent.  In return for his cooperation, he was given $1,000 by the Vancouver Police Department to satisfy the drug debt and promised a monthly stipend during the investigation, a cash payment at the conclusion of all proceedings, and entry into the witness protection program.",
            "50                               Based on their agreement with Molsberry, the police applied for a consent wiretap authorization under s. 184.2  of the Criminal Code .  This provision was enacted in response to this Court’s decision in Duarte and permits the interception of private communications with the consent of a participant under judicial authorization.  An application under this section may be made ex parte by a peace officer on the strength of an affidavit deposing to the following matters:"

        "Facts": " 2.In February 1983, the respondent, Beare, was charged with breaking, entering and theft, contrary tos. 306(1)(b) of theCriminal Code. He was served with an appearance notice requiring him to attend in court and to appear at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (R.C.M.P.) offices \"for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". The latter Act, by s. 2, provides that a person in lawful custody may be subjected to certain processes of identification, the best known today, of course, being fingerprinting, which has been sanctioned by the Governor in Council pursuant to this provision; see SOR/48‑412. Section 2 reads as follows:  2. (1) Any person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable offence, or who has been apprehended under theExtradition Actor theFugitive Offenders Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view.  (2) Such force may be used as is necessary to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes and operations.  (3) The signaletic cards and other results thereof may be published for the purpose of affording information to officers and others engaged in the execution or administration of the law.  A person to whom an appearance notice is given is, by s. 453.3(3) of theCriminal Codedeemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 453.3(3) at the relevant time read as follows:  453.3...  (3) An appearance notice or promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.  This provision was subsequently amended (S.C. 1985, c. 19, s. 77), but in a manner that does not affect the disposition of this appeal.  3.If a person fails to appear as required by such notice, a warrant may be issued for his arrest (s. 453.4). He is also guilty of an offence under s. 133(5) of theCode.  4.In December, 1982, the respondent, Higgins, was charged with defrauding Soo Security Motorways of more than $200 contrary tos. 338(1)of theCriminal Code. He was served with a summons requiring him to attend in court and to appear at R.C.M.P. offices \"for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act\". By section 455.5(5) of theCode, a person so summoned is also deemed to be a person in lawful custody for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act. Section 455.5(5) reads:  455.5...  (5) A summons may, where the accused is alleged to have committed an indictable offence, require the accused to appear at a time and place stated therein for the purposes of theIdentification of Criminals Act, and a person so appearing is deemed, for the purposes only of that Act, to be in lawful custody charged with an indictable offence.  A person who fails to comply with such a summons is also subject to arrest by warrant (s. 455.6) and is guilty of an offence (s. 133(4)).  5.Neither Beare nor Higgins attended at the R.C.M.P. offices as required. Both challenged the requirement that they appear for fingerprinting as being a violation of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On March 14, 1983, Rutherford J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of Saskatchewan dismissed Beare's application without recorded reasons. On April 4, 1983, Higgins' application was also dismissed by Maurice J. who gave reasons.  6.Higgins' application was for relief pursuant to theCharter, particularly ss. 8, 11(d),24(1)and pursuant tos. 52(1)of theConstitution Act, 1982. Though Maurice J. thought the application contained procedural defects, he nonetheless proceeded to examine the merits of the case and concluded that theIdentification of Criminals Actdid not contravene ss. 8 and 11(d) and even if it did, the Act would be saved bys. 1of theCharter.  7.Both respondents appealed to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. The appeals were heard together. Both argued that a requirement subjecting an accused to fingerprinting under theIdentification of Criminals Actbefore conviction for an indictable offence infringed upon his rights as guaranteed by theCharter. Though reliance was placed onss. 7,8,9,10,11(c)and (d) of theCharter, the court restricted its considerations to s. 7.  8.By judgment dated April 14, 1987, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173, [1987] 4 W.W.R. 309, 57 C.R. (3d) 193 (hereinafter cited from (1987), 56 Sask. R. 173), and ruled that to the extent that they provide for the fingerprinting of a person charged with but not convicted of an indictable offence, s. 2 of theIdentification of Criminals Actand ss. 453.3(3) and 455.5(5) of theCriminal Codeviolates. 7of theCharterand are of no force and effect. The violation did not constitute a reasonable limit within the meaning ofs. 1of theCharter. Separate judgments were given by Bayda C.J.S. (Brownridge J.A. concurring) and Cameron J.A.  9.In Bayda C.J.S.'s view, the concept \"life, liberty and security of the person\" refers not only to physical but to mental integrity. The latter, he observed, could be subsumed in the phrase \"the dignity and worth of the person.\" As he saw it, subjecting a person to fingerprinting prior to conviction violates the elements of dignity and self‑respect inherent ins. 7of theCharter. He states at p. 182:  It is common knowledge that fingerprinting is not carried out universally but only in respect of those thought to have engaged in criminal activity ... that in the minds of the public fingerprinting is associated with criminals and criminal activity: to be fingerprinted is to be treated like a criminal. It is one thing, however, to have been found by a court to be a criminal and then to be treated like one. It is quite another not to have been so found (particularly when the person has an honest belief in his innocence) and to be treated like one. The humiliation is exacerbated when the person realizes that the fingerprints remain as a permanent record, a permanent stigma, notwithstanding the withdrawal or the dismissal of the charge. That such a person's reputation, self‑respect or dignity may suffer in the process is patent.  10.Bayda C.J.S. was of the opinion that this violation was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, given the absence of safeguards in s. 2 of the Act to prevent injury to those whom there is no need to identify or those who fall subject to the Act but are not criminals. He noted that the person in authority who has the power to require the fingerprinting need not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the accused had committed the offence. That person could be arbitrary and capricious. In Bayda C.J.S.'s view the belief of the person who laid the charge is irrelevant. The final indignity, he noted, is the lack of any requirement to destroy the fingerprints if the accused is discharged. He referred to the British statute, thePolice and Criminal Evidence Act 1984(U.K.), 1984, c. 60, that incorporates such safeguards.  11.Bayda C.J.S. then went on to consider whether the legislation might be saved unders. 1of theCharterand concluded that it could not.  12.Cameron J.A. arrived at the same conclusion by a somewhat different route. After disposing of a number of procedural and jurisdictional issues not raised in this Court, and referring to the decisions of this Court inRe B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, andHunter v. Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, as establishing the applicable principles, he went on to discuss theIdentification of Criminals Actin terms of these principles.  13.To the extent that the Act applies to a person in custody, accused but not convicted of the commission of a serious crime, he stated, its purposes are to enable the identity of that person to be established for three reasons: (1) to assist in determining whether the accused committed the crime in those cases where the identity of the person who committed the crime is in issue; (2) to assist in determining if the accused has been convicted or stands charged of other crimes in order to establish whether and on what terms the accused might be released pending trial, whether the complaint ought to be presented by way of summary conviction or indictment, whether to proceed by way of second conviction, and so on; and (3) to facilitate the apprehension of the accused should he fail to appear in court. He, too, noted that there are no provisions governing the ultimate disposition of the fingerprints in the event of a withdrawal of the charge, a stay or an acquittal.  14.Cameron J.A. considered that the impugned provisions of the Act and of theCriminal Codedeprive the person affected thereby of liberty and security of the person. The person is required by law to surrender himself into the custody of the authorities, or face arrest and prosecution, and must submit to the bodily intrusions sanctioned by s. 2 of the Act. Such bodily force as is necessary to that end may lawfully be used. "

The appellant obtained an \"eight-ball\" (3.5 gr.) of cocaine.  He did not seek to determine the quality or potency of the cocaine before injecting the drug intravenously into himself and Frank Caddedu.  With the consent of the deceased, the appellant then injected a quantity of cocaine into the deceased's right forearm.  She immediately began to convulse violently and appeared to cease breathing.  Subsequent expert testimony confirmed that, as a result of the injection, she had experienced a cardiac arrest, and later asphyxiated on the contents of her stomach.  Both the appellant and Mr. Caddedu attempted unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ms. Martin.  Mr. Caddedu indicated he wanted to call for emergency assistance but the appellant, by verbal intimidation, convinced Mr. Caddedu not to call 911.  The appellant placed the deceased, who was still convulsing, on her bed.  The appellant then proceeded to clean the apartment of any possible fingerprints.  The two men then left the apartment.  Mr. Caddedu returned unaccompanied to the deceased's apartment six or seven hours later and called for emergency assistance.  Ms. Martin was thereupon pronounced dead.  The appellant related a substantially different version of the events in question, but this testimony was disbelieved by the trial judge. The appellant was charged with manslaughter.  Defence counsel conceded at trial that the injection into the deceased's body constituted \"trafficking\" within the meaning of s. 4(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. N-1.  The Crown argued that the appellant was guilty of manslaughter as Ms. Martin's death was the direct consequence of an unlawful act, contrary tos. 222(5)(a) of theCriminal Code.  The appellant was convicted of manslaughter on May 18, 1990, and sentenced to four years' imprisonment.  The appellant appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal, which affirmed the conviction. "

        "Facts": "[2]In 2009, Mr. MacDonald was employed in the oil and gas industry.  His employment required him to spend time in both Calgary and Halifax.  On the evening of December 28, 2009, Mr. MacDonald entertained a co-worker and his co-worker’s friend at his Halifax condominium (the “unit”).  Some alcohol was consumed during the evening as Mr. MacDonald and his colleague — who was about to replace him in Halifax — discussed work. [3]Later in the evening, the concierge of Mr. MacDonald’s building, Mr. Sears, received a noise complaint regarding loud music reverberating from the unit.  Mr. Sears went to the unit, heard the loud music and knocked on the door.  He received no response.  Just as he was about to leave, he saw Mr. MacDonald’s guests leaving the unit and saying good night.  At this point, Mr. Sears asked Mr. MacDonald to turn down his music.  Mr. MacDonald, swearing at him, refused to do so. [4]Mr. Sears contacted the Halifax Regional Police and asked them to deal with the complaint about the noise issue.  Cst. Pierce went to the building and, together with Mr. Sears, approached Mr. MacDonald’s unit.  Cst. Pierce knocked on his door and asked him to turn his music down or off.  Mr. MacDonald swore at her and slammed the door shut. [5]Cst. Pierce contacted her supervisor, Sgt. Boyd, who arrived at the building approximately a half hour later.  Sgt. Boyd, Cst. Pierce and Mr. Sears went to the unit.  Sgt. Boyd tried to get Mr. MacDonald to answer the door by knocking on it and kicking it, and also shouted that he was from the Halifax Regional Police. [6]About five minutes later, Mr. MacDonald opened the door, but only about 16 inches — enough for the officers to see the right side of his body and face.  Sgt. Boyd noticed something “black and shiny” in Mr. MacDonald’s right hand that was in a shadow and was partially hidden by his right leg (A.R., at p. 167).  He believed it might be a knife.  He twice asked Mr. MacDonald what was behind his leg, gesturing toward his right hand.  Mr. MacDonald did not respond. [7]Wanting to get a better look at what Mr. MacDonald had in his hand, Sgt. Boyd pushed the door open a few inches further.  The resulting light enabled him to identify it as a handgun.  He yelled “gun!” and quickly forced his way into the unit.  After a brief struggle, he was able to disarm Mr. MacDonald. [8]The gun that Mr. MacDonald was holding when he opened the door was found to be a 9-mm Beretta — a restricted firearm.  It was registered to him.  The gun was loaded. [9]Mr. MacDonald was charged with numerous offences, three of which are relevant here:  handling a firearm in a careless manner or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons, contrary to s. 86(1) of theCode; unlawfully having in his possession a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88(1); and possessing, in a place, a loaded restricted firearm without being the holder of an authorization or a licence under which he may possess the said firearm in that place, contrary to s. 95(1)."

Bean of the Ontario Provincial Court (Family Division) at Toronto and was arraigned on a charge which alleged that he:  . . . on or about the 23rd day of September in the year 1985 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York unlawfully did have in his possession property to wit:  four shirts and two sweaters, of a value exceeding two hundred dollars, knowing that all of the property was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment, contrary to theCriminal Code.  Before a plea was entered, counsel for the respondent indicated that he wished to bring a motion alleging that the failure of the Lieutenant Governor in Council for the province of Ontario to designate \"alternative measures programs\" for the purposes of s. 4 of theYoung Offenders Actresulted in a violation of the respondent's equality rights, as guaranteed bys. 15of theCharter.  Counsel for the respondent indicated that the remedy sought was an order pursuant tos. 24(1)of theCharterstaying the proceedings or dismissing the charge.

        "Facts": " 2.On August 28, 1980, Schmidt, with the assistance of her son, Charles Gress, and a friend of his, Paul Hildebrand, is alleged to have abducted a two‑year old girl, Denise Gravely, from a Cleveland sidewalk. Schmidt took the child with her to New York State, where she kept her for almost two years, raising her as her daughter. In the interim, the child's father committed suicide, allegedly as a result of his inability to discover his child's whereabouts.  3.On March 22, 1982, Schmidt attended a family reunion in Buffalo, New York, accompanied by Denise. Another son of hers, Donald Gress, was also at the reunion. By sheer coincidence, Donald Gress not only came from Cleveland but knew the child's parents and had helped to search for her after her abduction. Following the reunion, he told Cleveland police of Denise's whereabouts and she was returned to her mother on March 26, 1982.  4.Following her arrest, Schmidt was charged with the federal offence of kidnapping and the state offence of child‑stealing. Grand juries returned indictments on both charges, on March 29, 1982 on the state charge and on March 31, 1982 on the federal charge.  5.The two charges have some similarities but they also have important differences. The federal offence under theUnited States Code, Title 18 reads:  §1201. Kidnapping  (a) Whoever unlawfully seizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for ransom or reward or otherwise any person, except in the case of a minor by the parent thereof, when:  (1) the person is willfully transported in interstate or foreign commerce;  (2) any such act against the person is done within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States;  (3) any such act against the person is done within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 101(36) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1301(36)); or  (4) the person is a foreign official, an internationally protected person, or an official guest as those terms are defined in section 1116(b) of this title,  shall be punished by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.  The offence under theRevised Code of Ohioreads:  §2905.04‑‑Child Stealing  (A) No person, by any means, and with purpose to withhold a child under the age of fourteen or mentally incompetent from the legal custody of his parent, guardian or custodian, shall remove such child from the place where he is found.  (B) It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the actor reasonably believed that his conduct was necessary to preserve the child's health or welfare.  6.On July 26, 1982, Schmidt was tried on the federal charge by a judge and jury. She admitted the abduction, but contended that she had taken part in it in the belief that Denise was the illegitimate daughter of her son Donald Gress, and that she had been abandoned by her father and was living with her natural mother \"in a home of ill repute\". On July 30, 1982, the jury found Schmidt not guilty and she was acquitted.  7.On August 6, 1982, while the state offence of child‑stealing was still pending, Schmidt, who is a Canadian citizen, left the United States and came to Canada. She was arrested in Kirkland Lake, Ontario on August 30, 1982 and extradition proceedings against her were begun pursuant to the Canada‑United States extradition treaty.  8.I should add that Schmidt's counsel argues that if Schmidt is returned to Ohio, she will not have the benefit of raising her previous federal prosecution in bar of her prosecution under state law. While under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a person is protected from double jeopardy against federal prosecutions, that provision does not apply to the states although at some point the cruelty of harassment by multiple prosecutions by a state would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: seeBartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121 (1959). It is clear, however, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not automatically protect an individual from being prosecuted under a state law although the accused was earlier tried and acquitted of an offence under federal law. Thus inBartkus v. Illinois,supra, the accused was tried and acquitted under a federal law of robbing a federally insured bank. He was later tried and convicted on substantially the same evidence in an Illinois state court for violating an Illinois robbery statute. On an action to test the constitutionality of the second prosecution, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Illinois prosecution did not violate the due process clause. "

        "Facts": " Scott Jones had a history of sexual assault.  On May 28, 1982 he was convicted of rape, attempted rape and gross indecency for incidents involving young girls aged 10, 12 and 13.  When the police sought to arrest Jones for these incidents, he confronted them with a loaded shotgun for which he was convicted of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace.  Jones was sentenced to five years in prison for these incidents.  On November 25, 1985, Jones was released under parole.  On October 24, 1986, Jones sexually assaulted a 26-year-old woman, having forced her into his car and confined her there.  Jones was alleged to have committed a sexual assault against a 14-year-old girl on October 26, 1986.  On November 5, one day after being questioned for the earlier sexual assaults, Jones sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl at knife point.  On November 7, Jones was charged with three counts of sexual assault with a weapon (contrary to s. 246.2 of theCriminal Code) and three counts of unlawful confinement (contrary to s. 247(2) of theCode).  On November 18, 1986, the appellant's lawyer requested that he be remanded for observation to determine if he was mentally ill.  In particular, the appellant's counsel requested the order to determine whether the appellant was fit to stand trial, was sane at the time of the alleged offences and to gain some insight into the appellant for the purpose of sentencing.  He was so remanded pursuant to s. 465(1)(c)(iii) of theCode.  A 30-day remand order was issued \"for purposes of medical and/or psychiatric observation\".  Two psychiatrists and one psychologist examined the appellant at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute.  Prior to the first examination, Dr. Lohrasbe warned the appellant that none of the discussions would be confidential and that all information that was provided could be used against the appellant in the course of the proceedings.  A second psychiatrist, Dr. Semrau, also examined the appellant and warned him that the interview was not confidential and could be used against him in court.  He also advised the appellant of his right to talk to counsel.  The psychologist, Dr. La Torre, warned the appellant prior to his interview with him that anything he said could be used in a court of law.  Although the trial judge found that the appellant was adequately warned that his discussions with the psychiatrists could be used against him, he was not specifically warned that the evidence of the psychiatrists could be used to assist in determining whether or not he was a dangerous offender.  In the course of assessing the appellant's mental health, Dr. Lohrasbe became concerned about the appellant's potential for future violence.  These concerns emerged from Mr. Jones himself who stated during the examination that he was a danger to potential victims.  Although Dr. Lohrasbe considered the implications of the use of this evidence at the dangerous offender stage, he did not fundamentally alter his method of interviewing.  While he administered a slightly different intelligence test (using a more widely accepted version), the focus of the testing was identical to the one to determine the state of Jones' mental health.  The appellant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual assault with a weapon.  During the dangerous offender proceedings that followed, the trial judge conducted avoir direin which the appellant challenged the admissibility of the evidence from the three doctors at the Forensic Psychiatric Institute on the grounds that to admit this evidence would breach hiss. 7Charterrights.  The trial judge found that the evidence was admissible in spite of the fact that additional warnings had not been given to the appellant about the possible use of this psychiatric testimony in dangerous offender proceedings.  Dr. Lohrasbe found that the appellant was extremely dangerous and he could see no basis for a change in this psychological make-up in the foreseeable future.  He concluded that placing the appellant in the community would put other young women at risk.  Dr. La Torre found that the appellant had considerable hostility toward women and that his lack of insight into his problem created a strong risk that he would re-offend.  Dr. Semrau found that the appellant's sexual assault tendency followed a very dangerous pattern that was highly likely to repeat itself in the future.  The two doctors testifying on behalf of the appellant accepted the deep-seated nature of the appellant's problems.  However, they were of the view that treatment over the normal period of detention could prevent the appellant from re-offending.  The trial judge concluded that the appellant was dangerous within the meaning of theCode.

        "Facts": " In 1987, Christine Naglik (to whom I shall refer as \"Naglik\", as she is both appellant and respondent before this Court) and her common law husband, Peter Geoffrey Pople, were charged with the aggravated assault of, and failure to provide necessaries of life to, their infant son Peter Naglik.  The Crown proceeded by indictment.  The evidence established that Peter Naglik, then aged 11 weeks, was brought to hospital where he was found to have sustained a number of serious injuries (including a broken collarbone, fractured ribs in at least 15 places, a fractured vertebra, two separate skull fractures, and haemorrhaging of the brain and the retina) which had caused permanent damage.  The injuries had been sustained over a period of time, estimated by physicians to be four weeks.  Naglik gave exculpatory statements concerning her child's condition to police and other authorities which were inconsistent with the medical evidence at trial.  At trial before a judge and jury, Naglik did not testify.  Pople did testify, denying any involvement in causing the injuries to the child, and claiming that Naglik was the child's primary caregiver.  Pople's counsel sought, and obtained, permission to comment on the failure of Naglik to testify.  The trial judge allowed the comment, warning counsel that it had \"better be within the bounds of propriety\".  In his address, Pople's counsel stated, in part:  The evidence shows that it must have been at least one of them.  Now, he has sworn before you that it wasn't him.  Your eyes turn to the other and she does not get up and deny it.  Her counsel makes an effort to put it on Peter Pople, to accuse him conjecturally, but she doesn't get up or explain anything or accuse anyone.  In response, Naglik's counsel explaineds. 11(c)of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and pointed out that she had made exculpatory statements to various persons in authority at the first opportunity, unlike Pople.  Naglik's counsel also moved for a mistrial because of the comment, but the motion was denied.  In his charge to the jury, the trial judge remarked that, unders. 215of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46(formerly s. 197), the appropri­ate test to be applied was an objective one, and that the jury should convict if they were of the view that the parent \"knew, or ought to have known, the seriousness of the child's con­dition and that it required medical attention\".  With respect to the need for a unanimous verdict, the trial judge initially charged the jury as follows:  In other words, each and all of you must agree on each verdict that you see fit to return with respect to each accused.  It is your right to disagree but I know you will do your best to come to an agreement.  This trial has involved considerable time and expense and there have been the lives of people, your lives, the lives of witnesses, have been disrupted and I am certain that no other jury can deal with this matter better than you.  The jury retired at 3:08 p.m.  They returned to ask a question at 3:35 p.m., which the trial judge answered, and then again at 4:35 p.m., when they asked \"Do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty?\"  The trial judge answered this question as follows:  Your question is \"do we have to agree on guilty or not guilty\".  Well, the 12 of you have to agree on a verdict of guilty or not guilty with respect to count one and with respect to each accused.  In other words, you must be unanimous one way or the other with respect to each accused and with respect to each count.  Is that confusing?  In other words, you have to look at count one and you have to consider the evidence with respect to each accused and bring in your verdict one way or the other.  The 12 of you have to come to a decision one way or the other.  The jury returned verdicts of guilty on both counts for both Naglik and Pople at 8:08 p.m., and was polled at the request of defence counsel.  Both were sentenced to four and one-half years on the first count (aggravated assault) and two years on the second count (failure to provide necessaries), to be served concurrently.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed Naglik's appeal from her conviction on the second count (failure to provide necessaries), set aside the conviction, and ordered a new trial on that count:  (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 385, 65 C.C.C. (3d) 272, 46 O.A.C. 81.  Naglik has appealed the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to comment by counsel for a co-accused by leave, and with respect to the charge to the jury as of right (based on a dissent by Morden A.C.J.O.).  The Attorney General for Ontario has cross-appealed the Court of Appeal's ruling with respect to themens reafor s. 215 by leave.

        "Facts": " A.Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island and Reference re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island   11These two cases, which were heard together in these proceedings, arose out of two references which were issued by the Lieutenant Governor in Council of P.E.I. to the Appeal Division of the P.E.I. Supreme Court.  12The first reference,Reference re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on October 11, 1994 by Order in Council No. EC646/94, pursuant to s. 18 of theSupreme Court Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. S-10, and came about as a result of reductions in the salaries of judges of the P.E.I. Provincial Court by thePublic Sector Pay Reduction Act, S.P.E.I. 1994, c. 51.  This statute reduced the salaries of the judges and others paid from the public purse in P.E.I. by 7.5 percent effective May 17, 1994.  The Act was part of the province’s plan to reduce its budget deficit.  Following the pay reduction, numerous accused persons challenged the constitutionality of proceedings before them in the Provincial Court, alleging that as a result of the salary reductions, the court had lost its status as an independent and impartial tribunal unders. 11(d)of theCharter.  In response to the uncertainty created by these challenges, the provincial government issued a reference to elucidate the constitutional contours of the power of the provincial legislature to decrease, increase or otherwise adjust the remuneration of judges of the Provincial Court, and to determine whether the judges of the Provincial Court still enjoyed a sufficient degree of financial security for the purposes of s. 11(d).  The Appeal Division rendered judgment on December 16, 1994: (1994), 125 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 335, 389 A.P.R. 335, 120 D.L.R. (4th) 449, 95 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 33 C.P.C. (3d) 76, [1994] P.E.I.J. No. 123 (QL).  For present purposes, it is sufficient to simply state that the court found the judges of the Provincial Court to be independent.  13The second reference,Reference re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the  Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island, was issued on February 13, 1995, by Order in Council No. EC132/95, and arose out of the controversy surrounding the first reference.  Despite the Appeal Division’s decision in the first reference, accused persons continued to raise challenges based on s. 11(d) to the constitutionality of the P.E.I. Provincial Court.  In particular, Plamondon Prov. Ct. J. (formerly Chief Judge) issued a judgment in which he strongly criticized the Appeal Division’s decision, and refused to follow it:R. v. Avery, [1995] P.E.I.J. No. 42 (QL).  14The second reference was much more comprehensive in nature, and contained a series of questions concerning all three elements of the judicial independence of the P.E.I. Provincial Court: financial security (the issue in the first reference), security of tenure, and institutional (or administrative) independence.  The Appeal Division rendered judgment on May 4, 1995, and answered most of the questions to the effect that the Provincial Court was independent and impartial: (1995), 130 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 29, 405 A.P.R. 29, 124 D.L.R. (4th) 528, 39 C.P.C. (3d) 241, [1995] P.E.I.J. No. 66 (QL).  The appellants (who are the same appellants as in the first reference) appeal from this holding.  However, the court did hold that Provincial Court judges lacked a sufficient degree of security of tenure to meet the standard set bys. 11(d)of theCharter.  The respondent Crown cross-appeals from this aspect of the judgment.  15Because of their length and complexity, I have chosen to append the questions put in the two P.E.I. references as Appendices “A” and “B”.  B.R. v. Campbell, R. v. Ekmecic and R. v. Wickman  16This appeal arises out of three separate and unrelated criminal proceedings commenced against the respondents Shawn Carl Campbell, Ivica Ekmecic, and Percy Dwight Wickman in the province of Alberta.  Campbell was charged with unlawful possession of a prohibited weapon, contrary tos. 90(1)of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, and subsequently, in connection with the charge of unlawful possession, with failing to attend court in contravention ofs. 145(5)of theCriminal Code.   Wickman was charged with two different offences — operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate that vehicle was impaired by alcohol, in violation ofs. 253(a) of theCriminal Code, and operating a motor vehicle after having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams, in contravention ofs. 253(b) of theCriminal Code.  Ekmecic was charged with unlawful assault contrary tos. 266of theCriminal Code.  17The three respondents pled not guilty, and the Crown elected to proceed summarily in all three cases.  The accused appeared, in separate proceedings, before the Alberta Provincial Court.  At various points in their trials, they each brought a motion before the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, arguing that the Provincial Court was not an independent and impartial tribunal for the purposes of s. 11(d).  The trials for Campbell and Ekmecic were both adjourned before they commenced.  Wickman, by contrast, moved for and was granted an adjournment after the Crown had completed its case and six witnesses had testified for the defence, including the accused.  Amongst the three of them, the respondents sought orders in the nature of prohibition,certiorari, declarations, and stays.  18The allegations of unconstitutionality,inter alia, dealt with a 5 percent  reduction in the salaries of judges of the Provincial Court brought about by thePayment to Provincial Judges Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 116/94, and s. 17(1) of theProvincial Court Judges Act, S.A. 1981, c. P-20.1, which is the statutory basis for the aforementioned regulation.  The 5 percent reduction was accomplished by a 3.1 percent direct salary reduction, and by 5 unpaid days leave of absence.  The respondents also attacked the constitutionality of changes to the judges’ pension plan by theProvincial Judges and Masters in Chambers Pension Plan Amendment Regulation, Alta. Reg. 29/92, and theManagement Employees Pension Plan, Alta. Reg. 367/93, which respectively had the effect of reducing the base salary for calculating pension benefits, and limiting cost of living increases to 60 percent of the Consumer Price Index.  In addition, the respondents challenged the constitutionality of the power of the Attorney General to designate the court’s sitting days and judges’ place of residence.  McDonald J., on the motions, also put at issue the process for disciplining Provincial Court judges and the grounds for removal of judges of the Provincial Court.  19Finally, and in large part, the constitutional challenges seem to have been precipitated by the remarks of Premier Ralph Klein during a radio interview.  Mr. Klein stated that a judge of the provincial youth court, who had indicated that he would not sit in protest over his salary reduction, should be “very, very quickly fired”.  20All three motions were heard by McDonald J., who found that the Alberta Provincial Court was no longer independent: (1994), 160 A.R. 81, 25 Alta. L.R. (3d) 158, [1995] 2 W.W.R. 469, [1994] A.J. No. 866 (QL).  However, he obviated the need for a stay by issuing a declaration that provincial legislation and regulations which were the source of the s. 11(d) violation were of no force or effect.  As a result, although the Crown lost on the constitutional issue, it won on the issue of the stay.  The Crown appealed to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeals, and therefore did not consider the merits of the arguments: (1995), 169 A.R. 178, 97 W.A.C. 178, 31 Alta. L.R. (3d) 190, 100 C.C.C. (3d) 167, [1995] 8 W.W.R. 747, [1995] A.J. No. 610 (QL).  The Crown now appeals to this Court, both on the question of the Court of Appeal’s jurisdiction and the merits of the constitutional issue.  I stated constitutional questions on June 26, 1996.  These questions can be found in Appendix “C”.  C.Manitoba Provincial Judges Assn. v. Manitoba (Minister of Justice)  21This appeal deals with reductions to the salaries of judges of the Manitoba Provincial Court, byThe Public Sector Reduced Work Week and Compensation Management Act, S.M. 1993, c. 21, otherwise known as “Bill 22”.  Bill 22 led to the reduction of the salaries of a large number of public sector employees, including employees of Crown corporations, hospitals, personal care homes, child and family services agencies, municipalities, school boards, universities and colleges.  The legislation was passed as part of a plan to reduce the province’s deficit.  Bill 22 provided for different treatment of the several classes of employees to which it applied.  It provided that public sector employers “may” require employees to take unpaid days of leave.  However, judges of the Provincial Court, along with persons who received remuneration as members of a Crown agency or a board, commission or committee to which they were appointed by the government, received a mandatory reduction of 3.8 percent in the 1993-94 fiscal year.  For the next fiscal year, Bill 22 provided that judges’ salaries were to be reduced  by an amount that is generally equivalent to the amount by which the wages of employees under a collective agreement with Her Majesty in right of Manitoba are reduced in the same period as a result of a requirement to take days or portions of days of leave without pay in that period.

Ct. J. ordered the exclusion of the public and the media, with the exception of the accused, the victims, their immediate families and a victim services coordinator, from those parts of the sentencing proceedings dealing with the specific acts committed by Carson.  The exclusion order remained in effect for approximately 20 minutes.  The order was sought on the basis of the nature of the evidence, which the court had not yet heard, and which purportedly established that the offence was of a“very delicate”nature.  Crown counsel further pointed to the fact that the case involved young, female persons.  3.         André Veniot, a CBC reporter, was excluded from the court along with the other members of the media and the public.  Shortly after the public had been invited to reattend the proceedings, a lawyer retained by Veniot was granted permission to address the court.  She requested that Rice Prov.

The evidence disclosed that Schwartz had bought the two handguns in 1978 from one of his employees, Horst Schimiczek, who had acquired the .38 Special in Texas and the .44 Magnum in North Dakota. Schimiczek had moved to Winnipeg, duly registered the two weapons, and then sold the guns to Schwartz. He gave Schwartz the registration papers, in Schimiczek's name. Later, an application in Schwartz's name for a firearms acquisition certificate, the necessary first step to obtain a registration certificate, was received by the Firearms Section of the City of Winnipeg Police Department. At the time, the Firearms Section was under control of Staff Sergeant Gordon Pilcher, who reviewed the application and determined that a notice of intention to refuse a firearms acquisition certificate should be sent to Schwartz. A notice to this effect was delivered to Schwartz by double registered mail.  3.Approximately nine months after the notice was mailed, members of the Winnipeg Police Department executed a search of Schwartz's home, and located and confiscated a .44 Magnum and a .38 Special.  4.Schwartz proceeded to trial before Allen Prov. Ct. J. and was convicted on both charges. He was fined $50 on each charge. On appeal, Barkman Co. Ct. J. allowed the appeal and quashed the convictions. The Crown then appealed to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (Hall J.A., Matas J.A. concurring, and Huband J.A. dissenting in part). The acquittals were set aside and convictions restored.

Much of the evidence at trial came from an agreed statement of facts.  It was admitted by the appellant that he had made arrangements, several days before the incident, to return to his native country, India, along with his two children.  To this end, he purchased three airline tickets and collected them on May 2, 1986.  He also purchased a number of other items during this period, including an axe and a suitcase.  The appellant admitted that he and his wife argued over a number of matters several days before the incident, to the extent that his wife left their home in order to stay with relatives for a short time, returning only on the afternoon of May 2, 1986.  The argument that caused her to leave was precipitated in part by the appellant's decision to quit his job.  The spouses had also disagreed on numerous occasions as to whether the family should return to India.  Immediately after killing his wife, the appellant tried but failed to enlist the help of friends in order to remove her body from the home. He finally severed the body into smaller parts with an axe and disposed of them in a nearby river.  He cleaned the premises and later made attempts to enter the United States.

            "Consider the situation in which a person must decide whether or not to speak to the police.  Once the decision to speak is made in the criminal law context (absent concerns about voluntariness or exclusion for Charter  breaches), the evidence is available for all purposes. The law recognizes some protected situations, such as where compelled testimony cannot be used against the witness in other proceedings.  But generally speaking, once the decision to speak is made, the evidence so obtained is admissible if relevant.  I am far from convinced that the same general principle should not operate with respect to consent to provide blood samples in the criminal law context.  We do not give effect to the individual's desire to speak on condition that what is said is helpful to his or her case.  Likewise, I do not think we should open the door to conditional or limited consents in the criminal law context.",
            "The context and circumstances are markedly different in the case of consent given to police to take blood as part of the investigation of a serious criminal charge than where consent is given for the purpose of medical treatment.  There is a  high level of expectation of privacy and confidentiality associated with medical treatment and an important benefit in its being provided. Moreover, where the blood sample has been properly obtained for a medical purpose, the police will usually have the option of seeking prior judicial authorization to seize the sample. The consent relates to taking the sample from the body.  Once the sample is in existence, the results of its analysis may be obtained upon suitable prior judicial authorization.  The context is quite different in a case such as the present one.  The consent is elicited in the criminal law context and for law enforcement purposes.  There is no confusion between medical treatment and criminal investigation.  There will often be no alternative investigative technique available in absence of consent.  Without the blood sample in this case, as Constable Roberts conceded in cross-examination, there was no other evidence. This is not to say that any and all techniques are permitted to get evidence when it is otherwise hard to come by.  It is to point out that balancing the reasonable expectation of privacy and the needs of law enforcement must take account of the context and circumstances in the particular situation."

(B)Mr. El Zein  (i)Mr. El Zein is a Canadian citizen;  (ii)on December 17, 1984 he was arrested in Canada pursuant to a warrant issued under theExtradition Actand the Extradition Treaty between Canada and the United States;  (iii)the warrant alleged that El Zein had imported heroin into the United States and that he participated in a conspiracy to import and distribute heroin in the United States;  (iv)all of El Zein's actions relating to the allegations took place in Canada and at no time did El Zein leave Canada.  The extradition of each accused to the United States was sought on the ground that the drug enforcement laws of the United States extend beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States where the object of the illegal activity is to bring the drugs into the United States.  Canada has similar legislation governing the importation of drugs into and the exportation of drugs out of Canada.  It is common ground that each accused could have been charged by Canadian authorities with violating s. 423(1)(d) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and s. 5 of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1. "

        "Facts": "(Friesen, at para. 93) [219]It must be remembered that even when child luring is committed in the context of a police operation, it must never be seen “as a victimless crime” (Friesen, at para. 94). [220]It is difficult to claim that the conduct of an offender arrested as a result of a sting operation poses no risk of harm. Parliament designed the offence of child luring precisely to prevent such a risk from materializing, that is, to apprehend “offenders before they can successfully target and harm children” (Friesen, at para. 94). In this sense, police operations are a key element in the arsenal available to law enforcement agencies to apprehend offenders before it is too late (para. 94). [221]In short, requiring a high level ofmens reaensures that the offence of child luring captures only conduct that involves a high degree of moral blameworthiness as well as serious harm or a risk of such harm (Friesen, at para. 76). (b)The Effects of the Minimum Term of Imprisonment on the Offenders in the Reasonably Foreseeable Hypothetical Scenarios Are Not Incompatible With Human Dignity [222]In addition to the scope of the offence, the grossly disproportionate nature of a mandatory minimum sentence is assessed in light of the effects that the penalty may have on the reasonably foreseeable offender (Hills, at para. 133). If these effects entail so much pain and suffering that they undermine human dignity, the impugned provision cannot survive constitutional scrutiny (para. 133). That is not the case here. [223]For both of the hypothetical offenders, the effects identified by my colleague relate to the treatment they might receive in prison. It seems that imprisonment itself — and not its length — is what plays a major role in her analysis. Although my colleague refrains from concluding that the effects in question, which, I might add, are inherent to incarceration, are such as to undermine human dignity, she nevertheless finds that the first offender’s individual circumstances “would likely make her experience of incarceration perilously grave” (para. 151) and that, for the second offender, “[t]he six‑month mandatory minimum in this case is a far cry from the shortest possible rehabilitative sentence” (para. 152). Such reasoning has major implications; its logical consequence is that any minimum term of imprisonment that may be imposed on an offender who has just reached adulthood or on a person with a mental illness will be grossly disproportionate, regardless of the gravity of the offence or the circumstances surrounding its commission. Such an outcome seems to me to be entirely inconsistent with the deference owed to Parliament. Indeed, “if few mandatory minimums can survive the scrutiny exemplified in [my colleague’s] reasons on s. 12, then one must question what role is left for Parliament’s legitimate policy choices in setting punishment” (Lloyd, at para. 107, per Wagner J. (as he then was), Gascon and Brown JJ., dissenting). [224]In any event, as explained above, I conclude that a nine‑month term of imprisonment would be fit and appropriate for the offender in the first hypothetical scenario and that a six‑month term of imprisonment is a fit and appropriate punishment in the second hypothetical scenario. In the first case, the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence provided for in s. 172.1(2)(a) results in an additional period of imprisonment of three months. In the second case, the application of s. 172.1(2)Cr. C.would therefore result in an additional six months’ imprisonment if the offence were prosecuted by indictment. [225]I cannot bring myself to conclude that any additional period of imprisonment has effects that are incompatible with human dignity, because this would amount to indirectly introducing a standard of proportionality. I wish to make one important clarification. My remarks should not be taken to mean that, once incarceration is found to be the fit and appropriate punishment, any additional period of imprisonment is immune from constitutional scrutiny because the offender in question already has to deal with the negative effects associated with imprisonment. In this case, however, there is nothing in the record that allows me to identify “the precise harm associated” with this additional period of imprisonment (Hills, at para. 133). Nevertheless, since the period is relatively short, I am of the view that its effects are not incompatible with human dignity. (c)The Minimum Term of Imprisonment Is Not Grossly Disproportionate to What Is Necessary To Achieve Parliament’s Objectives [226]The final stage of the analysis is meant to determine whether the minimum sentence “goes beyond what is necessary to achieve Parliament’s sentencing objectives relevant to the offence” (Hills, at para. 138). In this inquiry, courts must consider “the legitimate purposes of punishment and the adequacy of possible alternatives” (Hills, at para. 138, quotingR. v. Smith, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at pp. 1099‑1100). However, it is essential to bear in mind at this stage that gross disproportionality is the constitutional standard that applies in the analysis unders. 12of theCharter. I reiterate this because, in my opinion, my colleague’s reasoning transforms the standard of gross disproportionality into one of proportionality. [227]This shift in her analysis can first be seen at para. 158, where she argues that, for offenders whose mental illness contributed to the commission of an offence, “specific deterrence, general deterrence and denunciation are of little use”. With respect, this argument misses the mark."

For a second or subsequent offence, the accused is, under s. 235(2), liable to a greater punishment. At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asked that the court impose a greater punishment because of previous convictions and established that notice had been given to the accused prior to his plea in compliance withs. 740of theCriminal Codewhich requires that in order to impose a greater punishment the court must be satisfied that the defendant, before making his plea, was notified that, upon conviction, a greater punishment would be sought.  3.As actual proof of the convictions, the Crown simply produced a document entitled \"Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving Record\" pursuant to s. 75 of theMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288 (as amended by S.B.C. 1982, c. 36, s. 16). The document listed previous convictions. The accused objected to the production of the document on three grounds:  a)                that said Notice of Greater Punishment lacked                    sufficient particularity;  b)                that he was not sufficiently identified in the                          \"Certified Extract of British Columbia Driving                    Record\";  c)                that the \"Certified Extract of British Columbia                     Driving Record\" was not admissible at common law as                retained bys. 7(2)of theCriminal Codedespite s.            75 of theMotor Vehicle Actof B.C. and s. 37 of                    theCanada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

Result If the Mental Element Relates Solely to the Actus Reus Which Requires That the Prohibited Act Be Performed Voluntarily  Should it be thought that the mental element involved relates to theactus reusrather than themens reathen the result must be the same.  Theactus reusrequires that the prohibited criminal act be performed voluntarily as a willed act.  A person in a state of automatism cannot perform a voluntary willed act since the automatism has deprived the person of the ability to carry out such an act.  It follows that someone in an extreme state of intoxication akin to automatism must also be deprived of that ability.  Thus a fundamental aspect of theactus reusof the criminal act is absent.  It would equally infringes. 7of theCharterif an accused who was not acting voluntarily could be convicted of a criminal offence.  Here again the voluntary act of becoming intoxicated cannot be substituted for the voluntary action involved in sexual assault.  To do so would violate the principle set out inVaillancourt,supra.  Once again to convict in the face of such a fundamental denial of natural justice could not be justified unders. 1of theCharter.  Summary of Proposed Remedy  In my view, theChartercould be complied with, in crimes requiring only a general intent, if the accused were permitted to establish that, at the time of the offence, he was in a state of extreme intoxication akin to automatism or insanity.  Just as in a situation where it is sought to establish a state of insanity, the accused must bear the burden of establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that he was in that extreme state of intoxication.  This will undoubtedly require the testimony of an expert.  Obviously, it will be a rare situation where an accused is able to establish such an extreme degree of intoxication.  Yet, permitting such a procedure would mean that a defence would remain open that, due to the extreme degree of intoxication, the minimal mental element required by a general intent offence had not been established.  To permit this rare and limited defence in general intent offences is required so that the common law principles of intoxication can comply with theCharter.  In light of the experience in Australia or New Zealand, it cannot be said that to permit such a defence would open the floodgates to allow every accused who had a drink before committing the prohibited act to raise the defence of drunkenness.  As observed earlier, studies made in Australia and New Zealand indicate that there has not been any significant increase in the number of acquittals following theO'ConnorandKamipelidecisions.

The strike began as scheduled on January 25.  That afternoon a press conference was held at which approximately 30 members of the media were present.  While the president of the union, Margaret Ethier, indicated that the union was primarily concerned with achieving an appropriate settlement, she acknowledged the existence of \"the court orders that are coming at us now\", and when asked whether the union was breaking the laws of the province, answered \"Yes, that's correct.\"  When asked whether the possibility of an injunction meant anything, Ethier replied that the strike would be continuing \"until such time that a settlement is reached.\"  She indicated that she was aware that \"they now have [the cease and desist orders] filed with the court.\"  When questioned further about the illegality of the strike, she declined to agree that \"the law's an ass\", but continued to say that \"I've never looked too much to the law.  We've got a business to run; it's a private business dispute . . . .\"  On January 29 the Attorney General of Alberta filed a notice of motion seeking that the union be held in criminal contempt, and on February 3 the union was found guilty by Sinclair J. and a fine of $250,000 was levied.  A second press conference was held that day, and when the president of the union was asked whether the fact of a conviction would change the union's position in terms of staying off the job, she replied \"Well, as I said to you before we are prepared to go back any time we have an appropriate settlement and from the response of the AHA we don't have one.\"  On February 9 a second motion was filed alleging that the strike was continuing, and that the union continued to be in criminal contempt.  On February 18 the union was convicted of this second charge of criminal contempt by O'Byrne J. and fined $150,000.

        "Facts": " As no trial has yet been held in this matter, the facts have been taken from the evidence at the preliminary inquiry.  The transcript of the preliminary inquiry was filed with the Court of Appeal and with this Court as the factual basis for the appeals.  On December 31, 1987, Teresa Santos attended a New Year's Eve party in Toronto.  Shortly after midnight, a fight broke out at the party.  As she was attempting to gather her belongings, which were located at a table in the vicinity of the fight, Ms. Santos was struck on the arm by a piece of glass.  The glass fragment produced a large gash on her left forearm which required seven stitches to mend the underlying pronator muscle in her arm and a further seven stitches to mend the skin above the muscle.  Eight months later, the feeling and movement in the victim's forearm was still restricted.  The victim's husband, Fernando Santos, was standing near his wife while the fight was in progress.  He noticed that the appellant and a number of others were involved in the altercation.  The appellant and the Santos were standing approximately eight feet away from a wall on opposite sides of the same table.  Some of the men who were fighting began throwing bottles.  Mr. Santos then noticed the appellant throw a bottle which hit the wall beside Ms. Santos and shattered.  A piece of glass from the bottle thrown by the appellant ricocheted off the wall and struck the victim on the arm causing her injury.  As a result of this incident, the appellant was charged with unlawfully causing bodily harm contrary to s. 245.3  of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 (now s. 269).  He was committed for trial after a preliminary inquiry held on October 31, 1988.  At the outset of the trial and before any evidence was heard, the accused made a motion to have s. 269 declared of no force or effect on the ground that it contraveneds. 7of theCharter.  The motion was granted and the indictment was quashed.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the motion judgment was overturned and the order quashing the indictment was set aside.  This appeal comes before the Court as of right.

        "Facts": " 3.The facts of the case are straightforward and undisputed. The six appellants are practising members of the Roman Catholic faith. They have for many years attended Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Our Lady of Lourdes is one of ninety‑three parishes which make up the Diocese of Antigonish.  4.It has become the custom in this diocese for communion to be received standing by those able to do so. This custom is a relatively recent development. The previous practice had been for communion to be received kneeling. This change has been accepted and approved by the Bishop responsible for the diocese.  5.Nonetheless, the appellants continued to oppose this change in the liturgy. As a result of their opposition, there has been what has been characterized before us as an ongoing dispute between the appellants on the one hand and the priests and other members of this church, on the other hand.  6.To aid in the resolution of this dispute, the parish priest and his assistant drew up a directive concerning the procedures to be followed during mass. This directive dealt in particular with the manner in which communion was to be administered and received. This directive was regularly read during services to the parishioners prior to the day of the alleged offence.  7.On that day as well, this directive was read to the assembled congregation, among whom were then present most, if not all, of the appellants. The directive was again read shortly before communion was administered by which time all appellants were present.  8.When the point in the mass had been reached when communion was to be taken, the appellants, with the other members of the congregation who desired to receive communion, made their way to the back of the church. From there, two lines formed and made their way down the centre aisle towards the three communion stations at or near the altar. The two lines spread into three as they approached these communion stations.  9.As each accused arrived at a communion station, he or she knelt before the priest. They were each told to stand if they wished to receive communion. After a few seconds, each one stood and, without receiving communion, moved off in an orderly manner to the sides of the church and returned to his or her seat. "

            "5                                   This criterion has come to be known as the Dagenais/Mentuck test, after the decisions of this Court in which the governing principles were established and refined.  The issue in this case is whether that test, developed in the context of publication bans at the time of trial, applies as well at the pre-charge or “investigative stage” of criminal proceedings.  More particularly, whether it applies to “sealing orders” concerning search warrants and the informations upon which their issuance was judicially authorized.",
            "On September 2, 2003, the Crown brought an ex parte application in open court in the Ontario Court of Justice for an order sealing the search warrants, the informations used to obtain the warrants and related documents.  The Crown claimed that public disclosure of the material could identify a confidential informant and could interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation.",
            "22                               These principles, as they apply in the criminal investigative context, were subsequently adopted by Parliament and codified in s. 487.3  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 .  That provision does not govern this case, since our concern here is with warrants issued under the Provincial Offences Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.  It nonetheless provides a useful reference point since it encapsulates in statutory form the common law that governs, in the absence of valid legislation to the contrary, throughout Canada.",
            "23                               Section 487.3(2) is of particular relevance to this case.  It contemplates a sealing order on the ground that the ends of justice would be subverted, in that disclosure of the information would compromise the nature and extent of an ongoing investigation.  That is what the Crown argued here.  It is doubtless a proper ground for a sealing order with respect to an information used to obtain a provincial warrant and not only to informations under the Criminal Code .  In either case, however, the ground must not just be asserted in the abstract; it must be supported by particularized grounds related to the investigation that is said to be imperilled.  And that, as we shall see, is what Doherty J.A. found to be lacking here.",
            "While the test was developed in the context of publication bans, it is equally applicable to all discretionary actions by a trial judge to limit freedom of expression by the press during judicial proceedings.  Discretion must be exercised in accordance with the Charter , whether it arises under the common law, as is the case with a publication ban . . .; is authorized by statute, for example under s. 486(1)  of the Criminal Code  which allows the exclusion of the public from judicial proceedings in certain circumstances (Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), [[1996] 3 S.C.R. 480], at para. 69); or under rules of court, for example, a confidentiality order (Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522, 2002 SCC 41).",
            "39                               Second, Doherty J.A. found that the affiant’s concern, for which he offered no specific basis, amounted to a mere assertion that “the police might have an advantage in questioning some individuals if those individuals [are] unaware of the details of the police investigation” (para. 27).  In oral argument before this Court, counsel for the Crown referred to this as the “advantage of surprise”.  In this regard, Doherty J.A. noted Iacobucci J.’s conclusion in Mentuck, at para. 34, that access to court documents cannot be denied solely for the purpose of giving law enforcement officers an investigative advantage; rather, the party seeking confidentiality must at the very least allege a serious and specific risk to the integrity of the criminal investigation."

        "Facts": " On April 21, 1984, Michel Fortin was found dead in his home, the victim of two gun‑shot wounds in the head.  The respondent was arrested the following day and questioned by police with respect to the incident.  He had been charged and convicted, approximately three years earlier, of assaulting the victim.  The respondent refused to speak to any police officers and was released several days later.  Almost four months later, in response to renewed questioning by the police, the respondent confessed to having caused the death of Mr. Fortin.  He admitted that he had planned the event:  he had acquired a firearm for this purpose some time earlier and had entered the home of the victim on the day in question with the weapon concealed on his person. After firing two shots at the victim's head, he left the premises, threw the firearm in a river and returned to his own home.  The respondent was convicted of first degree murder by a jury in the Superior Court of Quebec.  The respondent conceded that he had committed the physical act of killing Mr. Fortin, but argued that he should be found not guilty by reason of insanity pursuant tos. 16of theCriminal Code.  Uncontradicted evidence was given at trial that the respondent suffered from a severe psychosis that made him believe that he was God and had a mission to destroy all forces of evil on Earth.  He suffered from the further delusion that Mr. Fortin was \"Satan\" and that he had to kill him in order to rid the Earth effectively of all evil forces.  The respondent knew that murder was a crime and that he would in all likelihood be arrested for this act, but he believed nevertheless that the act was necessary in order to fulfill his Divine mission.  The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the insanity defence, stating that the respondent should not be convicted if he lacked the capacity, because of disease of the mind, to appreciate the nature or quality of his act or to know that the act was legally wrong.  The Court of Appeal of Quebec unanimously set aside the respondent's conviction and substituted a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity: (1988), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 552, 26 Q.A.C. 194 (hereinafter cited to C.C.C.). "

        "Facts": " The trial judge’s different treatment of Farmer would be understandable if Clayton and Farmer had been two unconnected pedestrians who happened to be leaving the Million Dollar Saloon parking lot at the same time, but independently.  However that is not this case.  Farmer, being black, fit the general description by the 911 caller.  He was leaving the parking lot in the same car as Clayton soon after the 911 gun call.  Once the trial judge concluded that sufficient grounds existed to require Clayton to get out of the car and submit to a search for reasons of police safety incidental to detention it follows, I think that it would have been foolhardy for the police, in the context of a gun call, to leave Farmer, possibly armed, in the car while they went about their business with Clayton.  Nor could the police be expected to allow Farmer to drive away.  If Farmer, left alone in the driver’s seat, had taken a shot at the police, there would have been legitimate questions raised about police training and police judgment and the unreality of a law that led to such an avoidable result.  The respondents were travelling together and the concerns about officer safety raised by the glove-wearing, possibly gun-flourishing Clayton gave rise to a sufficient concern about the driver to warrant a pat-down search of Farmer for officer safety incidental (at that point) to Farmer’s continued detention.  Nevertheless, this point is complicated in Farmer’s case because, before he was searched, he was arrested.  125Farmer was out of the car and was putting his hands on the roof when Clayton tried to bolt (trial judgment, at paras. 23-24).  The arresting officer initially testified that he did not arrest Farmer until after he received word that Clayton had a gun.  However, the police tapes showed thisnotto be the case.  The arresting officer had no such information.  Accordingly, the trial judge concluded that “[a] reasonable person placed in [Constable] Mulholland’s position could not conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest” (para. 82).  The search of Farmer took placeafterhis arrest.  The trial judge therefore found:  The search was conducted in a reasonable manner and incident to an arrest.  However, the arrest was unlawful and the search violated Mr. Farmer’s s. 8 rights. [para. 83]  The trial judge thus treated the intervening arrest as determinative of Farmer’s rights.  It seems to me overly formalistic however to hold that, while the police were entitled to conduct a pat-down search of Farmer incidental to his continued detention, the entitlement vanished with the wrongful pronouncement of the words of arrest, even though the officer safety issue remained the same.  To put it another way, I do not think the effect of the arrest can be said to haveenlargedFarmer’s reasonable expectation of privacy.  An arrest, of course, gives the police greater powers of search than aManndetention, but the fact is that what happened to Farmer was a pat-down search well within the bounds of aManndetention.  126I would therefore hold that the pat-down search of Farmer that resulted in the seizure of the gun was not rendered unconstitutional by the words of arrest that intervened between getting Farmer out of the car and the police pat-down search to ensure officer safety.  Had I concluded otherwise, I would, nevertheless, have agreed with the trial judge that the gun should be admitted under s. 24(2).  L.In Any Event, Section 24(2) Was Properly Invoked in Farmer’s Case  127In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. stated that:  The trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis proceeded on the basis that the initial stop was constitutional.  I have concluded that it was unconstitutional.  It follows that the usual deference owed to a trial judge’s s. 24(2) analysis has no application . . . . [para. 69]  As, on the contrary, I accept the trial judge’s conclusion that the initial stop was constitutional, I would have been prepared to defer to the trial judge’s s. 24(2) decision to admit the gun as evidence against Farmer. 128All parties agree that s. 24(2) requires the application of the well-known three-part test articulated inR. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265.  The court looks first at the effect of the admission of the impugned evidence on the fairness of the trial, second at the seriousness of theCharterviolation and third at the negative impact, if any, on the administration of justice that would be occasioned by the admission of the evidence.  Both the trial judge and Doherty J.A. agreed, as do I, that admission of the gun would not affect trial fairness.  Doherty J.A.’s view of the seriousness of theCharterbreach was predicated on his conclusion that the original blockade detention was unconstitutional.  He states:  Farmer and Clayton were entitled to proceed on their way.  Instead, they found themselves in a potentially demeaning and frightening confrontation with the police.  The roadblock stop led to a serious violation of theirCharterrights.   The significance of theCharterbreaches is not minimized because it turns out that Farmer and Clayton were in possession of loaded prohibited weapons. . . . Criminals do not have different constitutional rights than the rest of the community. [paras. 77-78]  On the s. 24(2) point, I accept the conclusion of the trial judge who held that, while theCharterviolations were not “technical or trivial, they were not serious enough as to support exclusion” (para. 99).  In support of his conclusion the trial judge observed that  the violations occurred in a fast-paced situation, where the officer had little time for reflection. . . .  . . . the fact it was a gun call is an important consideration.   Constable Mulholland saw the Robson-Clayton struggle and Clayton’s flight. . . . As regards the search incident to arrest, the officer honestly but mistakenly believed he had the information that would give him reasonable and probable grounds.  Again, there is no bad faith. [paras. 95 and 97-98]  129As stated, Doherty J.A. made an important point about the potential contribution of inadequate training to excessive police conduct.  ACharterviolation caused by systemic failure would raise greater concerns for the administration of justice than an isolated act of a single misguided police officer.  However, given my conclusion that the roadblock (i.e., detention) was valid, I do not think the adequacy of police training emerges as a s. 24(2) consideration in this case.  130As to whether admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, I agree with the trial judge that “[t]he evidence sought to be excluded is essential to the prosecution of serious charges.  The officer had legitimate concerns for his safety.  Given the fast-paced events over a brief period of time as noted above, the officers had to make quick decisions without time for reflection.  I consider as well the nature of the search contemplated” (para. 100).  The trial judge therefore held:  To exclude the evidence of a loaded gun in these circumstances, would bring the administration of justice into greater disrepute than would occur if it was admitted. [para. 101]  131I agree.  If it had been necessary to resort to s. 24(2), my view is that the gun found on Farmer was properly admitted in evidence.

        "Facts": " In the absence of an objective of sufficient importance to justify overriding the right of free expression, the state's interest in suppressing expression which may potentially affect a public interest cannot outweigh the individual's constitutional right of freedom of expression and s. 181 cannot be upheld unders. 1of theCharter.  But even if one were to attribute to s. 181 an objective of promoting social and racial tolerance in society and manage the further leap of concluding that objective was so pressing and substantial as to be capable of overriding entrenched rights, the Crown's case unders. 1of theCharterwould fail for want of proportionality between the potential reach of s. 181 on the one hand, and the \"evil\" to which it is said to be directed on the other.  Assuming a rational link between the objective of social harmony ands. 181of theCriminal Code, the breadth of the section is such that it goes much further than necessary to achieve that aim.  Accepting that the legislative solution need not be \"perfect\", it nevertheless must be \"appropriately and carefully tailored in the context of the infringed right\":Reference re ss. 193 and 195.1(1)(c) of the Criminal Code (Man.), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1123, at p. 1138.  The effect of s. 181 is to inhibit the expression or publication of any statements which may be found by a jury to be factual, false and likely to cause injury or mischief to a public interest.  The territory covered by this prohibition can only be described as vast, as revealed by a brief look at the key phrases on which guilt or innocence turns.  The phrase \"statement, tale or news\", while it may not extend to the realm of true opinion (wherever the line is to be drawn, itself a question of great difficulty), obviously encompasses a broad range of historical and social speech, going well beyond what is patent or provable to the senses as a matter of \"pure fact\". Indeed, one of the cases relied upon in support of the proposition that the section deals only with statements of fact and not with expressions of opinion,R. v. Hoaglin,supra, demonstrates just how slippery the distinction may be. If the expression in issue in that case, in which a disaffected American settler in Alberta had printed posters which stated \"Americans not wanted in Canada; investigate before buying land or taking homesteads in this country\" is an example of a \"false statement of fact\" falling within the prohibition, one shudders to consider what other comments might be so construed. Nor are the difficulties confined to determining what is a factual assertion as opposed to an expression of opinion.  What is false may, as the case on appeal illustrates, be determined by reference to what is generally (or, as inHoaglin, officially) accepted as true, with the result that the knowledge of falsity required for guilt may be inferred from the impugned expression's divergence from prevailing or officially accepted beliefs.  This makes possible conviction for virtually any statement which does not accord with currently accepted \"truths\", and lends force to the argument that the section could be used (or abused) in a circular fashion essentially to permit the prosecution of unpopular ideas.  Particularly with regard to the historical fact -- historical opinion dichotomy, we cannot be mindful enough both of the evolving concept of history and of its manipulation in the past to promote and perpetuate certain messages.  The danger is not confined to totalitarian states like the Nazi regime in Germany or certain communist regimes of the past which blatantly rewrote history.  We in Canada need look no further than the `not so noble savage' portrayal of Native Canadians in our children's history text books in the early part of this century.  Similarly, in the United States, one finds the ongoing revision of the historical representation of African Americans, whose contribution to aspects of the history of the United States, such as their contribution to the North's victory in the Civil War, is only now being recognized.  But perhaps the greatest danger of s. 181 lies in the undefined and virtually unlimited reach of the phrase \"injury or mischief to a public interest\".  Neither the respondent nor its supporting interveners has proffered any case law in which this phrase has been applied to a given factual circumstance in a clear and consistent manner.  My colleagues refer to the \"serious harm\" and \"serious injury\" caused by deliberate falsehoods, but this begs the question of what sort or degree of harm is necessary in order to bring the section into play. Indeed, the limited jurisprudence on s. 181 evidences conflicting opinions on what constitutes a threatened or injured \"public interest\" justifying criminal sanction.  It is difficult to see how a broad, undefined phrase such as \"public interest\" can on its face constitute a restrained, appropriately limited measure which impairs the right infringed to the minimum degree consistent with securing the legislation's objectives.  Any deliberate lie (potentially defined as that which does not accord with accepted truth), which causes or is likely to cause \"injury\" or  \"mischief\" to any \"public interest\" is within the potential reach of the section.  The interpretation given to \"public interest\" in this case may not have been objectionable.  But that is not the issue in determining whether a legislative restriction of rights is overbroad.  The issue is whether the provision permits the state to restrict constitutional rights in circumstances and ways that may not be justifiable.  The vague and broad wording of s. 181 leaves open that possibility.  Cory and Iacobucci JJ. propose to overcome this difficulty by defining the phrase \"public interest\" in accordance with selectedChartervalues.  Two observations are relied upon -- that courts regularly define phrases in legislation, and that the courts have not, thus far, adequately defined \"public interest\" -- as the justification to define anew \"public interest\" in the context of s. 181's purported application to Mr. Zundel.  Although the section's \"legislative history\" and the \"legislative and social context in which it is used\" is said by my colleagues to govern the definitional process, their interpretation focuses upon a select range ofChartervalues, values which do not include freedom of expression.  In support of this technique, reliance is placed upon the following authorities:Hills v. Canada (Attorney General), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 513;Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; andR. v. Salituro, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 654.  These authorities confirm the following basic propositions: that the common law should develop in accordance with the values of theCharter(Salituro,supra, at p. 675), and that where a legislative provision, on a reasonable interpretation of its history and on the plain reading of its text, is subject to two equally persuasive interpretations, the Court should adopt that interpretation which accords with theCharterand the values to which it gives expression (HillsandSlaight,supra).  None of these decisions stands for the proposition that an age-old provision whose aim and scope was created pre-Chartercan, as of 1982, be redefined by reference to a present-day perception of utility.  The result of my colleagues' redefinition is the equation of \"public interest\" with \"the protection and preservation of those rights and freedoms set out in theCharteras fundamental to Canadian society\" (p. 000). Thus, for example, whenever the Crown can establish that the publication of a false statement is likely seriously to injure the dignity and equality of those whomss. 15and27of theCharterare intended to protect, the offence is made out. In so doing my colleagues have arguably created a new offence, an offence hitherto unknown to the criminal law. The promotion of equality and multiculturalism is a laudable goal, but, with respect, I can see no basis in the history or language of s. 181 to suggest that it is the motivating goal behind its enactment or retention. To import it is to engage not in a valid process of statutory interpretation, but in impermissible reading in of content foreign to the enactment;Salituro,SlaightandHillswere never intended to be taken this far.  Section 181 can be used to inhibit statements which society considers should be inhibited, like those which denigrate vulnerable groups.  Its danger, however, lies in the fact that by its broad reach it criminalizes a vast penumbra of other statements merely because they might be thought to constitute a mischief to some public interest, however successive prosecutors and courts may wish to define these terms.  The danger is magnified because the prohibition affects not only those caught and prosecuted, but those who may refrain from saying what they would like to because of the fear that they will be caught.  Thus worthy minority groups or individuals may be inhibited from saying what they desire to say for fear that they might be prosecuted.  Should an activist be prevented from saying \"the rainforest of British Columbia is being destroyed\" because she fears criminal prosecution for spreading \"false news\" in the event that scientists conclude and a jury accepts that the statement is false and that it is likely to cause mischief to the British Columbia forest industry?  Should a concerned citizen fear prosecution for stating in the course of political debate that a nuclear power plant in her neighbourhood \"is destroying the health of the children living nearby\" for fear that scientific studies will later show that the injury was minimal?  Should a medical professional be precluded from describing an outbreak of meningitis as an epidemic for fear that a government or private organization will conclude and a jury accept that his statement is a deliberate assertion of a false fact?  Should a member of an ethnic minority whose brethren are being persecuted abroad be prevented from stating that the government has systematically ignored his compatriots' plight?  These examples suggest there is merit in the submission of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association that the overbreadth of s. 181 poses greater danger to minority interest groups worthy of popular support than it offers protection.  These examples illustrate s. 181's fatal flaw -- its overbreadth.  At pages 000-000, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. attempt to alleviate the fears associated with the problem of overbreadth by arguing that the Crown will always bear a heavy onus in proving all of the elements under s. 181.  It is argued that any danger is limited by the phrase \"public interest\" because even those publishing known falsehoods will not be prosecuted where their lies have an \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\".  In this way, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. claim that the examples proffered above raise no practical problem (see p. 000).  I, for one, find cold comfort in the assurance that a prosecutor's perception of \"overall beneficial or neutral effect\" affords adequate protection against undue impingement on the free expression of facts and opinions.  The whole purpose of enshrining rights in theCharteris to afford the individual protection against even the well-intentioned majority.  To justify an invasion of a constitutional right on the ground that public authorities can be trusted not to violate it unduly is to undermine the very premise upon which theCharteris predicated.  Cory and Iacobucci JJ. make no mention of the reality that the decision to prosecute must, by necessity, be made by state agents and that the issue must be adjudicated upon by a judge and jury in a particular locale with a particular conception of a benefit to the public.  All it takes is one judge and twelve jurors who believe that certain `falsehoods' compromise a particular \"public\" interest, and that such falsehoods `must have been' known to the accused, in order to convict.  A jury in Port Alberni, B.C., may have a very different view of the overall beneficial impact of false statements of fact impugning the lumber industry than a jury in Toronto.  Finally, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. fail to address the argument that the danger raised by these examples, the `chilling effect' of  s. 181, outweighs its minimal benefit given the alternative means of prosecution of speech detrimental to racial tolerance unders. 319of theCriminal Code.  Not only is s. 181 broad in contextual reach; it is particularly invasive because it chooses the most draconian of sanctions to effect its ends -- prosecution for an indictable offence under the criminal law.  Our law is premised on the view that only serious misconduct deserves criminal sanction.  Lesser wrongs are left to summary conviction and the civil law.  Lies, for the most part, have historically been left to the civil law of libel and slander; it has been the law of tort or delict that has assumed the main task of preserving harmony and justice between individuals and groups where words are concerned.  This is not to say that words cannot properly be constrained by the force of the criminal law.  But the harm addressed must be clear and pressing and the crime sufficiently circumscribed so as not to inhibit unduly expression which does not require that the ultimate sanction of the criminal law be brought to bear:  see Dickson C.J. inKeegstra,supra, at p. 772.   TheCriminal Codeprovisions against hatemongering met that criterion, focusing as they did on statements intended to cause \"hatred against any identifiable group\".  The broad, undefined term \"mischief to a public interest\", on the other hand, is capable of almost infinite extension.

        "Facts": " The appellants were charged with conspiracy to import marijuana between March 1, 1983 and September 12, 1983.  The Crown's case consisted principally of one hundred thirty-six intercepted communications.  At trial, avoir direwas held to determine the admissibility of the interceptions.  At its conclusion, the trial judge held all but nine inadmissible.  The Crown called no evidence before the jury and the trial judge directed the jury to acquit the appellants.  The Crown's appeal was allowed and a new trial was ordered: (1986), 33 D.L.R. (4th) 744, [1986] 5 W.W.R. 131, 29 C.C.C. (3d) 516, 53 C.R. (3d) 56.  This appeal is made as of right under s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code.  The case involved an intensive police investigation which was carried out in widely separated areas of the province of British Columbia, and resulted on September 11, 1983 in a seizure of 278 lbs. of marijuana in a vehicle driven by the appellant, McDonald, in which Rosen was a passenger.  The police were aware from the outset that those under investigation resorted to and made wide use of pay telephones as a means of communication, and that in doing so they used a code to advise each other of the locations at which they could be reached.  During the investigation, the police installed and operated interception devices upon several pay telephones, private residential premises and hotel rooms occupied by the appellants or some of them.  Three authorizations were procured by the authorities during the investigation.  The authorizations are identical except for the dates, the agent applying for the authorization, the names of the affiants, and the identities of the persons whose private communications may be intercepted (targets) in paragraph (c) in each authorization.  The first authorization ran from March 23, 1983 to May 21, 1983.  It included appellants Thompson, Rosen and Auld. It permitted interception of telephone communications at the addresses of the appellants \"or elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia resorted to by the said Perry Gordon THOMPSON, Beebe AULD, Ross Allen ROSEN . . . \".  The affidavit filed before the authorizing judge revealed that the police authorities intended to intercept communications at public pay telephones.  Acting under this authorization, intercepting equipment was installed at several residences and hotel rooms and six public pay telephones.  For ease of reference, paragraphs (c) and (d) of the first authorization are reproduced below.  (c)The identities of the known persons whose private communications may be intercepted and the places at which private communications may be intercepted are:  Perry Gordon THOMPSON 171-1st Avenue Cultis Lake, B.C.                  (tel. no. 858-9276)  Beebe AULD 171-1st Avenue Cultis Lake, B.C.                  (tel. no. 858-9276)  Ross Allen ROSEN 3968 A Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-6254)  Miron Renoldo KRULL 1601 - Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-9992)  Lori Christine MARSHALL 1601 - Columbia Valley Highway Cultus Lake, B.C.                 (tel. no. 858-9992)  or elsewhere in the Province of British Columbia resorted to by the said Perry Gordon THOMPSON, Beebe AULD, Ross Allen ROSEN, Miron Renoldo KRULL and Lori Christine MARSHALL.  (d)The persons whose identities are not known as of the date hereof whose private communications may be intercepted and the places at which private communications may be intercepted are:  (i)those persons who resort to or use the premises described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof, or  (ii)those persons who are in communication with the persons described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof apparently with respect to an offence mentioned in paragraph (a) hereof;  which private communications may be intercepted at any of the premises hereinbefore described and any place or premises in the Province of British Columbia resorted to or used by the persons described in sub-paragraph (c) hereof.  On May 19, 1983 a second authorization was granted.  It ran from May 19, 1983 to July 17, 1983, overlapping the first authorization by two days.  It named ten persons, including all appellants except McDonald.  A third authorization was granted on July 15, 1983, again overlapping its predecessor.  It named twelve persons, including all appellants except McDonald.  The equipment installed during the first authorization remained in place in most of the pay telephones until the end of the investigation.  This interception capability was not mentioned in the second authorization.  During the second authorization interception equipment was installed with respect to an additional five pay telephones.  These eleven pay telephones were not mentioned in the third authorization.  Before the conclusion of the investigation, interception equipment was installed in nine more pay telephones, making a total of twenty.  Likewise there was no mention in the second and third authorizations of a listening device having been installed during the currency of the first authorization at the business premises of 1721 Harvey Avenue, Kelowna, British Columbia.  On approximately twenty occasions tape recorders were left on \"automatic play mode\" overnight with respect to certain pay phones.  This resulted in interception of conversations of persons not covered by the authorizations.  This is apparently contrary to R.C.M.P. policy with respect to monitoring pay telephones.  On such occasions the procedure was to rewind the tape, and play enough of the intercepted conversation to determine if a \"target\" was speaking.  Only if a target was speaking would the whole conversation be listened to and noted.  Otherwise, the conversation would be played forward at a fast speed and a low volume so that it was unintelligible.  If, however, no targets were speaking but early in the conversation it became apparent that the conversation related to other criminal activity, the entire conversation would be listened to.

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged with mischief to property contrary to s. 387(3) (now s. 430(3)) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  In attempting to establish this offence, the Crown sought to introduce evidence of the whereabouts of the appellant obtained through the use of an electronic tracking device (a \"beeper\") installed in his car.  A beeper may be described as a radio transmitter, usually battery operated, which emits periodic signals that can be picked up by a radio receiver.  The background and manner of installation may briefly be summarized as follows.  The appellant had for some time been under surveillance by the Ontario Provincial Police (the O.P.P.) who suspected him of involvement in a recent murder in Morewood, Ontario which they believed to be linked to a series of similar killings in the area.  In the course of its homicide investigation, the O.P.P. on July 14, 1987 applied for a warrant to search the appellant's home and vehicle on the following grounds:  that the police had spotted the appellant driving his automobile towards his home shortly after the murder; that they had observed, in the back seat of his car, a pair of binoculars, a pair of work gloves, and a plastic rain coat, which appeared used; that they had observed under the car soil and vegetation (Timothy, a plant common to the area) similar to that found on the victim's property; that the appellant's voice sounded similar to that on a tape of someone who purported to be the murderer, though the voice appeared disguised and could not be positively identified; that the appellant had been a suspect in certain of the previous homicides; and that he had an extensive criminal record for break and enter, robbery, theft, and offences relating to offensive weapons.  The police obtained the warrant and conducted the search but found nothing in either the accused's home or vehicle to link him to any of the homicides.  Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, the police had towed the appellant's automobile to the police station to carry out the search.  Some time later, more than thirty hours after the expiration of the warrant, they installed an electronic tracking device in the interior of the appellant's vehicle.  The \"beeper\" was surreptitiously hidden in the foam in the back seat of the appellant's car, causing minor damage to the seat.  This, the trial judge held, was done on the basis of \"mere suspicion\" and it was, of course, done without judicial authorization.  The car was then returned to the appellant.  The beeper emitted a radio frequency transmission which could be detected by a police scanner for a distance of up to three kilometres.  Though the device was rather unsophisticated, and the person who installed it thought it was capable of giving only its general location, he had not counted on the ingenuity of the police who by listening to the tone and using an antenna held outside the window of a police vehicle could be led in a specific direction.  Along with constant visual surveillance, the device enabled the police to track the appellant's whereabouts at all times of the day or night.  The trial judge found that the police used the device on a constant basis for a period extending over many months, and pertinently, over a month prior to the commission of the offence alleged in the present case, both to track the vehicle in motion and to pinpoint its location when stationary.  On August 15, 1987, the day of the alleged offence, the police had lost visual contact with the appellant's vehicle but were able to trace its location using the beeper.  Upon moving to that location, the police established surveillance on a vehicle resembling the appellant's that was parked in a driveway.  Approximately two hours later, the police surveillance team heard a loud noise which sounded like metal crashing.  The crashing sound was caused by the felling of a Bell Canada communications tower, the value of which was in excess of $2 million.  Soon after, the police observed another vehicle, which was in fact the appellant's and appeared to be identical to the one they were watching, pull out of a laneway in a nearby field from which the crashing sound had emanated.  The second vehicle was later located at the appellant's residence.  On August 26, 1987, the O.P.P. observed the appellant sitting in his car in a field, where he had parked in an attempt to avoid the heavy police surveillance.  At this time, the police conducted a warrantless search of the appellant's vehicle and person.  Nothing was found.  Later that evening, the police obtained a warrant to search the appellant's vehicle.  When the car was vacuumed, melted pieces of metal, consistent with the metal guy wires of the Bell communications tower, were discovered.  On November 13, 1987, the appellant was charged with mischief to property over $1,000 with respect to the Bell tower.  The appellant brought a pre-trial motion for exclusion of the evidence relating to his whereabouts on August 15, 1987 on the ground that such evidence had been obtained in violation of his rights unders. 8of theCharter.  The trial judge granted the appellant's motion and refused to admit any of the evidence obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the use of the electronic tracking device.  As a result, he acquitted the appellant.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.

(3d) 45, 31 O.A.C. 21.  The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that the appellant could be convicted on the combined application of ss. 21(2) and 213(c).  The trial judge informed the jury that, by the operation of ss. 21(2) and 213(c), the appellant could be convicted as a party to murder even if he did not have objective foresight of the death of the victim.  The Court of Appeal found, therefore, that the instructions were not consistent with the judgment of this Court in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636.  (It should be noted that the Court of Appeal's judgment in this case was rendered prior to the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 633.)  The majority of the Court of Appeal, however, invoked the curative provisions of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46  (formerly s. 613(1)(b)(iii)), in order to uphold the appellant's conviction.  In dissenting reasons, Cory J.A. (as he then was) disagreed with the majority on this point.",
            "The appellant relies on the judgment of this Court in R. v. Martineau, supra.  Martineau involved a challenge to the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  A majority of the Court (Dickson C.J., Lamer C.J. and Wilson, Gonthier and Cory JJ.) held that s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  requires proof that an accused had subjective foresight of the death of his or her victim before a conviction for murder can be sustained. Under s. 213(a), however, an accused could be convicted of murder whether or not he intended to kill his victim or knew that death was a likely result of his conduct.  The provision thus violated ss. 7  and 11( d )  of the Charter  and was declared to be of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1)  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .",
            "In my opinion, a correct reading of Martineau does not support the respondent's submission.  In Martineau, as I noted above, this Court was asked to pronounce on the constitutional validity of s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code .  To answer this question, it was necessary to determine the minimum degree of mens rea required by the Charter  for the offence of murder.  The determination of this minimum constitutional mens rea requirement was therefore the live issue before this Court. Consequently, our finding in Martineau, that proof of subjective foresight of death is necessary in order to sustain a conviction for murder and that s. 213 (a) of the Criminal Code  violated the Charter  since it did not embrace this requirement, was not obiter dictum.  This finding was the ratio decidendi of the decision.",
            "I agree with the dissenting reasons of Cory J.A. in the Court of Appeal that the appellant's conviction should not be sustained through the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code .",
            "1.Does s. 213(c) of the Criminal Code  [now s. 230(c)] contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?",
            "2.If the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is s. 213 (c) of the Criminal Code  [now s. 230(c)] justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?",
            "3.Does s. 21(2) of the Criminal Code  contravene the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7 and/or 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?",
            "Yes, s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  contravenes the rights and freedoms guaranteed by ss. 7  and 11( d )  of the Charter  with respect to offences for which subjective foresight is a constitutional requirement in so far as it permits a party to be convicted on the basis that he or she \"ought to have known\" that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose.",
            "4.If the answer to question 3 is in the affirmative, is s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  justified under s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?"

        "Facts": " [4]The encounter at the centre of this appeal occurred at mid-day on November 17, 2003, in the Greenwood and Danforth area of Toronto.  With  four schools in the area and a history of student assaults, robberies, and drug offences occurring over the lunch hour, the three officers involved in the encounter were on patrol for the purposes of monitoring the area and maintaining a safe student environment. Two of the officers, Constables Worrell and Forde, were dressed in plainclothes and driving an unmarked car. Although on patrol, their primary task was to visit the various schools to determine if there were persons on school property who should not have been there — either non-students or students from another school. The third officer, Constable Gomes, was in uniform and driving a marked police car.  On “directed patrol”, he had been tasked with maintaining a visible police presence in the area in order to provide student reassurance and to deter crime during the high school lunch period.  [5]Mr. Grant, a young black man, was walking northbound on Greenwood Avenue when he came to the attention of Constables Worrell and Forde.  As the two officers drove past, Cst. Worrell testified that the appellant “stared” at them in an unusually intense manner and continued to do so as they proceeded down the street, while at the same time “fidgeting” with his coat and pants in a way that aroused their suspicions.  Given their purpose for being in the area and based on what he had just seen, Cst. Worrell decided that “maybe we should have a chat with this guy and see what’s up with him”.  Cst. Worrell wanted to know whether Mr. Grant was a student at one of the schools they were assigned to monitor, and, if he was not, whether he was headed to one of the schools anyway.  Noticing Cst. Gomes parked on the street ahead of Mr. Grant, and in light of his uniformed attire, the two plainclothes officers suggested to Cst. Gomes that he “have a chat” with the approaching appellant to determine if there was any need for concern.  [6]Cst. Gomes then got out of his car and initiated an exchange with Mr. Grant, while standing on the sidewalk directly in his intended path.  The officer asked the appellant “what was going on”, and requested his name and address.  In response, the appellant provided a provincial health card.  At one point, the appellant, behaving nervously, adjusted his jacket, prompting the officer to ask him to “keep his hands in front of him”.  By this point, the two other officers had returned and parked on the side of the street.  [7]Cst. Worrell testified on cross‑examination that he and Cst. Forde pulled up because he got a funny feeling based on Mr. Grant’s way of looking over at them, looking around “all over the place”, and adjusting himself. On direct examination he said that “[h]e still seemed to be, I don’t know, looking a bit nervous the way he was looking around, looking at us, looking around when speaking to Officer Gomes. And at this time, I suggested to my partner, you know, I don’t think it would hurt if we just go up to Officer Gomes and just stand by, just to make sure everything was okay.” Thus, after a brief period observing the exchange from their car, the two officers approached the pair on the sidewalk, identified themselves to the appellant as police officers by flashing their badges, and took up positions behind Cst. Gomes, obstructing the way forward.  The exchange between Cst. Gomes and Mr. Grant subsequent to the arrival of the two officers was as follows:  Q.   Have you ever been arrested before?  A.   I got into some trouble about three years ago.  Q.   Do you have anything on you that you shouldn’t?  A.   No. Well, I got a small bag of weed.  Q.   Where is it?  A.   It’s in my pocket.  Q.   Is that it?  A.   (Male puts his head down.) Yeah. Well, no.  Q.   Do you have other drugs on you?  A.   No, I just have the weed, that’s it.  Q.   Well, what is it that you have?  A.   I have a firearm.  [8]At this point, the officers arrested and searched the appellant, seizing the marijuana and a loaded revolver.  They then advised Mr. Grant of his right to counsel and took him to the police station."

        "Facts": " A challenged municipal by-law was repealed prior to a hearing inMoir v. The Corporation of the Village of Huntingdon(1891), 19 S.C.R. 363, leading to a conclusion that the appealing party had no actual interest and that a decision could have no effect on the parties except as to costs.  Similarly, in a fact situation analogous to this appeal, the Privy Council refused to address the constitutionality of challenged legislation where two statutes in question were repealed prior to the hearing:Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney- General for Canada, [1939] A.C. 117 (P.C.)  Appeals have not been entertained in situations in which the appellant had agreed to an undertaking to pay the respondent the damages awarded in the court below plus costs regardless of the disposition of the appeal:Coca-Cola Company of Canada Ltd. v. Mathews, [1944] S.C.R. 385, andSun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Jervis, [1944] A.C. 111.  InCoca-Cola v. Mathews, Rinfret C.J. held the result of the undertaking was to eliminate any furtherlisbetween the parties such that the Court would have been forced to decide an abstract proposition of law.  As well, the sale of a restaurant for which a renewal of a licence was sought as required by the impugned municipal by-law rendered an issue technically moot:Vic Restaurant Inc. v. City of Montreal, [1959] S.C.R. 58.  Issues in contention may be of a short duration resulting in an absence of a live controversy by the time of appellate review.  Such a situation arose inInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 2085 v. Winnipeg Builders' Exchange, [1967] S.C.R. 628, in which the cessation of a strike between the parties ended the actual dispute over the validity of an injunction prohibiting certain strike action by one party.  The particular circumstances of the parties to an action may also eliminate the tangible nature of a dispute.  The death of parties challenging the validity of a parole revocation hearing (Re Cadeddu and The Queen(1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 481 (C.A.)) and a speeding ticket (R. v. Mercure, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234) ended any concrete controversy between the parties.  As well, the inapplicability of a statute to the party challenging the legislation renders a dispute moot:Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357.  This is similar to those situations in which an appeal from a criminal conviction is seen as moot where the accused has fulfilled his sentence prior to an appeal:Re Maltby v. Attorney-General of Saskatchewan(1984), 10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. C.A.)  The issue of mootness has arisen more frequently in American jurisprudence, and there, the doctrine is more fully developed.  This may be due in part to the constitutional requirement, contained in s. 2(1) of Article III of the American Constitution, that there exist a \"case or controversy\":  Section 2.  [1]  The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;--to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;--to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;--to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;--to Controversies between two or more States;--between a State and Citizens of another State;--between Citizens of different States;--between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.  However, despite the constitutional enshrinement of the principle, the mootness doctrine has its roots in common law principles similar to those in Canada:  see \"The Mootness Doctrine in the Supreme Court\" (1974), 88Harvard L.R. 373, at p. 374.  Situations resulting in a finding of mootness are similar to those in Canada.  For example, inHall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45 (1969), a challenge to a Colorado voter residency requirement of six months was held moot due to a legislative change in the law removing the plaintiff from the application of the statute.  Mootness was also raised inUnited States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629 (1953), where a defendant voluntarily ceased allegedly unlawful conduct.  Similarly, inSibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), mootness was an issue where an accused completed his sentence prior to an appeal of his conviction.  The American jurisprudence indicates a similar willingness to consider the merits of an action in some circumstances even when the controversy is no longer concrete and tangible.  The rule that abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions will not be heard is not absolute (see:  Tribe,American Constitutional Law(2nd ed. 1988), at p. 84; Kates and Barker, \"Mootness in Judicial Proceedings: Toward a Coherent Theory\" (1974), 62Calif. L.R.1385).  A two-stage process is involved in which a court may consider the merits of an appeal even where the issue is moot. "

        "Facts": " As part of an investigation into drug trafficking, the Ontario Provincial Police and the Metropolitan Toronto Police rented an apartment in Mississauga which was to be occupied by a police informer who was working with an undercover police officer.  The apartment was equipped with audio-visual recording equipment installed in a wall.  Prior to the installation of the equipment, the informer and the undercover officer consented to the interception of their conversations, pursuant to the provisions of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34.  As a result of the operation, the undercover officer met a man named Paul Vidotto.  Some days after the meeting, Vidotto, the appellant Mario Duarte, and two others attended at the apartment and discussed a cocaine transaction with the undercover officer and the informer.  The undercover officer made notes of these and a subsequent conversation which he acknowledged were based upon a review of the tapes of the conversations.  The appellant was later charged with the offence of conspiracy to import a narcotic.  At trial, he challenged, on avoir dire, the validity of s. 178.11(2)(a) of theCodewhich excepts from the prohibition of unauthorized electronic surveillance, the interception of conversations to which one of the parties consents.  The trial judge, Trotter J., held that the actions of the authorities infringed the appellant's rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure unders. 8of theCharterand that the evidence thereby obtained was held not admissible.  The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal which unanimously allowed the appeal, set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial.  In reasons that I shall review later, Cory J.A. (as he then was) following American authorities dealing with the Fourth Amendment to the American Constitution, concluded that the interception of private conversations without a warrant but with the consent of one of the participants does not violates. 8of theCharter((1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 385).  Notice of Appeal was then filed in this Court and the following constitutional questions were stated:  1.Does section 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, legalizing the interception of private communications with the consent of the originator or intended recipient thereof, without the need for judicial authorization, infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed bys. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?  2.If section 178.11(2)(a) of theCriminal Codedoes infringe or deny the rights and freedoms guaranteed bys. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, is it justified bys. 1of theCharterand therefore not inconsistent with theConstitution Act, 1982?  The Attorneys General for Ontario and Quebec intervened to support the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a).  During the argument, counsel for the appellant, however, advanced the position that the constitutionality of s. 178.11(2)(a) might not really arise.  That provision, he noted, was really an exception to the criminal prohibition against the interception of private communications set forth in s. 178.11(1), an exception applicable both to the police and members of the public.  Action contemplated by that exception could not be made criminal by aCharterattack on its validity.  The real question, then, becomes whether, even though such action may not constitute a criminal offence, it would nonetheless, when undertaken by an instrumentality of the state, such as the police, violates. 8of theCharter.  In my view, that is the correct approach to the matter and I shall deal with it on this basis.

        "Facts": " 2In October 1970, Quebec was shaken by a serious political crisis.  Richard Therrien was then a minor and a first-year law student in the Université de Montréal law faculty.  He lived close to the faculty in his sister Colette’s apartment on Queen Mary Road.  Neither the brother nor the sister was at that time formally a member of the Front de libération du Québec (“F.L.Q.”), an association declared to be unlawful by s. 3 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970, SOR/70-444, enacted under theWar Measures Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 288. Richard Therrien’s sister was, however, a friend of Jacques Rose.  From October 17 to November 6, 1970, Paul Rose, Jacques Rose, Francis Simard and Bernard Lortie, the four F.L.Q. members associated with the kidnapping of the minister Pierre Laporte, hid in that apartment.  Richard Therrien’s involvement in these events was quite minor: he stayed in the apartment with them for only a few nights, preferring to keep his distance.  At one point, he went to get materials so that they could build a hideout, and at another time he mailed three letters at the request of one of these persons.  3On November 26, 1970, Richard Therrien was charged with illegally and unlawfully giving assistance to these four individuals with intent thereby to prevent, hinder and interfere with their apprehension, trial or punishment, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that they were members of the unlawful association, contrary to s. 5 of thePublic Order Regulations, 1970.  He was also charged with communicating statements on behalf of the said association, contrary to s. 4(c) of the Regulations.  On April 14, 1971, he pleaded guilty and on the following day Judge Antonio Lamer, then of the Superior Court (Criminal Division), sentenced him to imprisonment for one year.  4After serving his sentence, Richard Therrien continued his legal studies and received his licence.  In the spring of 1974, the examining committee of the Barreau du Québec, which was established to consider the appellant’s candidacy in view of the fact that he had a criminal record, recommended that he be admitted to the professional school of the Barreau.  His name was first entered on the Roll of the order on January 26, 1976. From 1976 to 1996, he practised law in various provincial legal aid offices in a competent and dignified manner, thus winning the respect of his colleagues and members of the bench.  5On August 20, 1987, on the appellant’s application, the Governor in Council granted him a pardon pursuant tos. 5(b) of theCriminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 12 (1st Supp.).  The document he received stated that it is evidence that he was of good behaviour and that the conviction in respect of which it is granted should no longer reflect adversely on his character.  It also stated that the pardon granted vacates the conviction and removes any disqualification to which the person so convicted is subject by virtue of any Act of the Parliament of Canada or a regulation made thereunder.  6Between 1989 and 1996, Mr. Therrien submitted his candidacy in five selection procedures for judicial appointments.  He was interviewed on four occasions by the committee for the selection of persons qualified for appointment as judges, and on each occasion committee members raised the issue of trouble with the law.  In 1991 and 1993, he revealed his previous conviction and stated that he had been pardoned.  His candidacy for the first two appointments was unsuccessful, and it appears clearly from the evidence of persons who were selection committee members at that time that his criminal record was a determining factor in the decision to reject his candidacy.  It is not clear whether the issue was directly addressed at the third interview, but there is no doubt that during the last selection process he did not disclose his criminal record or the fact that he had been pardoned, when he was asked the following series of questions:  [translation] “Have you ever been in trouble with the law or with the Barreau?  Has any disciplinary action ever been taken against you?  Are there any outstanding complaints against you?”  Judge Therrien testified to the committee of inquiry of the Conseil de la magistrature that he felt he was justified in answering “no” to these questions for two reasons.  First, he understood, at the time, that the pardon had vacated his conviction and that this was precisely what the law meant.  Second, his answer meant that he would be assessed on his personal qualities and merits, although he was convinced that the Minister of Justice would be informed about his record.  7On September 18, 1996, as a result of the favourable recommendation of the committee for the selection of persons qualified for appointment as judges, and after running checks with the Barreau du Québec and the Sûreté du Québec and confirming that his record was clear, the Minister of Justice recommended that Richard Therrien be appointed as a Judge of the Court of Québec.  In late October 1996, the Associate Chief Judge of the Court of Québec and chairman of the selection committee which had recommended Judge Therrien for appointment, Louise Provost, learned that he had been in trouble with the law in the early 1970s.  She advised the Minister of the situation and stated that the appellant had failed to disclose this information to the committee.  On November 11, 1996, the Minister lodged a complaint with the Quebec Conseil de la magistrature pursuant to s. 263C.J.A., requesting that the Conseil [translation] “determine whether Judge Richard Therrien is capable, in the circumstances, of fulfilling his role with dignity, honour and impartiality”.  He also lodged a complaint with the Barreau du Québec; however, that complaint was stayed pending a decision by the Conseil.  8In accordance with ss. 268 and 269C.J.A., the Conseil de la magistrature established a committee of inquiry to consider the matter, and the committee submitted its report on July 11, 1997.  A majority of the committee, Judge Rivet dissenting, found that the complaint was justified and recommended that procedures for the removal of Judge Therrien be initiated in accordance with ss. 279(b) and 95C.J.A.  9On July 22, 1997, pursuant to the majority recommendation of the committee of inquiry, the Conseil de la magistrature recommended to the Minister of Justice that he initiate the process to remove Judge Therrien by making a request to the Court of Appeal in accordance with s. 95C.J.A.  The request was made on August 11, 1997.  Concurrently with that proceeding, on October 2, 1997, Judge Therrien filed an application for judicial review in the Superior Court, seeking to have the committee’s inquiry report and the recommendation and the order of the Conseil de la magistrature suspending him declared void and of no effect, and seeking to have the request to the Court of Appeal dismissed.  At the same time, he filed a motion for declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of s. 95C.J.A.  In response to the application and motion, the Minister of Justice filed two motions to dismiss in which he claimed that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to dispose of the issues in conducting the inquiry referred to it pursuant to s. 95C.J.A.  On January 26, 1998, Cliche J. of the Quebec Superior Court dismissed the motions to dismiss.  10The Minister of Justice appealed the decisions of the Superior Court to the Court of Appeal.  On May 14, 1998, a majority of that Court, Beauregard J.A. dissenting, allowed the first appeal and dismissed the application for judicial review filed by Judge Therrien.  The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the second appeal, and dismissed the motion for declaratory judgment filed by Judge Therrien.  11On October 28, 1998, the five judges of the Court of Appeal submitted a report to the Minister of Justice following their inquiry, in which they recommended that the Government revoke Judge Therrien’s commission.

        "Facts": " 13Chow, Mapara, Wasfi and Shoemaker were jointly charged with the first degree murder of Chand.  Chand, while changing a licence plate on Chow’s car in Mapara’s car lot, was shot seven times by Shoemaker.  14The Crown’s theory of the case was that Chow was privy to Chand’s murder and knowingly remitted to the getaway driver, Binahmad, payment for the contract killing.  15Binahmad, a Crown witness who had been granted immunity from prosecution, testified that Mapara had hired Wasfi to murder Chand and that Wasfi, in turn, recruited Shoemaker to do the killing.  He stated that Chow gave him $7,000 as a “down payment” on the contract, that he remitted the $7,000 to Shoemaker, and that Chow, at Wasfi’s request, gave him an additional $2,000 after the killing to enable him to leave town.  16Chow’s defence was that his payment to Binahmad had nothing to do with the murder and was not intended for Shoemaker.  It related, he said, to a “marijuana project” that he had undertaken with Wasfi.  17Shoemaker did not testify.  18The Crown entered into evidence telephone conversations involving Chow, Wasfi and Mapara.  The calls had been intercepted pursuant to eleven successive authorizations, of which the sixth and seventh yielded evidence crucial to the prosecution’s case against Chow.  Chow sought unsuccessfully to exclude this evidence underss. 8and24(2)of theCharter.  19Oppal J. rejected Chow’s application.  He noted that the use of electronic means to intercept private communications constitutes a search and seizure that will be deemed unreasonable unders. 8of theCharterunless judicially authorized in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.Section 185(1)(e) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, stipulates that the affidavit accompanying an application must disclose the existence of known persons (“knowns”) whose conversations are targeted.  Failure to do so will render unlawful any ensuing interception of a “known’s” communications.  20Oppal J. thought there was “much evidence to indicate that [the police] ought to have known about the existence or identity of Chow” (Ruling onvoir dire, [2001] B.C.J. No. 2959 (QL), 2001 BCSC 1815, at para. 32).  He found it unnecessary, however, to determine whether Chow was a “known” when the first and second authorizations were sought and granted, since the Crown did not rely on any intercepts obtained as a result of any authorizations in which Chow was not named as a target.  Moreover, Oppal J. concluded that the validity of the first and second authorizations had no inherent bearing on the admissibility of the subsequent intercepts: since each authorization represented a separate order, its legality was to be independently determined.  21At the conclusion of the Crown’s case, Chow and Wasfi both applied for severance.  Oppal J. allowed Wasfi’s application, but not Chow’s. ApplyingR. v. Torbiak and Gillis(1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), he held that the “issue to be ultimately determined by the court is whether the refusal to order a separate trial [would result] in a miscarriage of justice”.  Oppal J. found that Chow’s application failed on that test since Shoemaker’s anticipated testimony was of “marginal” import.  22Chow and Mapara both testified.  Shoemaker did not, but in a statement to the police admitted at the trial, he denied having received any payment at all for the killing.  Chow testified that the intercepted telephone calls referred to a marijuana deal and that, in two calls, he realized that Wasfi was referring to a contract killing but said he was not interested.  He said that he thought the money he paid to Binahmad was for the “marijuana project”.  23Chow, Shoemaker and Mapara were all convicted by the jury of first degree murder.  24Chow and Mapara appealed.  Chow’s main grounds were that Oppal J. erred in refusing to grant him a separate trial and in admitting the wiretap evidence.  He submitted as well that the verdict was unreasonable and sought to adduce “fresh evidence” in the form of an affidavit (a “will say” statement) by Shoemaker.  The essence of the affidavit was that Shoemaker, if compelled to testify, would state that he had not received the $7,000 from Binahmad.  25Shoemaker was cross-examined by the Crown on his affidavit. On re-examination by Chow’s counsel, he stated that Binahmad had told him, on the day Binahmad received the $7,000 from Chow, that he (Binahmad) had to attend a meeting about “some old weed business”.  26Speaking for the Court of Appeal, Donald J.A. agreed with the trial judge that « Shoemaker’s evidence was too marginal to justify a severance » (para. 22).  He found that the wiretaps had been properly admitted and that the verdict was reasonable and supported by the evidence.  27After the appeal was heard, but before judgment was entered, Chow sought to re-open the hearing so as to take into account, on the issue of severance, Shoemaker’s reference to the “old weed business”.  Chow’s counsel stated that this aspect of Shoemaker’s examination was not raised at the hearing of the appeal because of his instructions and because of the pressures of time.  Neither explanation is compelling. 28Chow’s application for a re-opening of the appeal was dismissed ((2003), 182 B.C.A.C. 88, 2003 BCCA 248).

        "Facts": " [8]The appellant Andrew McIntosh was employed by theNational Postfrom August 1998 until February 2005.  He took an interest in then Prime Minister Jean Chrétien’s involvement with the Grand-Mère Golf Club located in Mr. Chrétien’s home riding of St-Maurice, Quebec.  His investigation led him to suspect Mr. Chrétien’s involvement with a 1997 loan from the BDBC to the Auberge Grand-Mère, a hotel located next to the golf club, and with other federal grants in the riding.  During his investigations, Mr. McIntosh contacted a person known to us only as X, but at that time X was unwilling to talk to Mr. McIntosh, even on a confidential basis.  A.The Secret Source  [9]However, in the Fall of 2000, another individual known only as Y contacted Mr. McIntosh and indicated that he or she had important information but would only disclose it in return for a promise of confidentiality.  Mr. McIntosh was generally authorized by the then editor-in-chief of theNational Postto give promises of confidentiality and he routinely did so.  The editor-in-chief testified that he considers himself a party to such promises of confidentiality.  Indeed, the reviewing judge found that “[a]ll of Mr. McIntosh’s work was done with the support of the then Editor-in-Chief” (para. 8).  [10]Mr. McIntosh testified that “[t]he condition I agreed to in order to gain access to these materials was that I would . . . give a blanket, unconditional promise of confidentiality to protect the identity of both X and Y” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 156).  [11]Y told Mr. McIntosh that he was acting on X’s behalf and explained that X was willing to provide McIntosh with documents and information concerning the Auberge Grand-Mère loan.  Based on materials received from Y, including what appeared to be copies of original documents from BDBC files and information received from other sources, Mr. McIntosh reported in theNational Postthat Mr. Chrétien had called the president of the BDBC and urged approval of the bank loan to Auberge Grand-Mère.  When asked by reporters to comment, Mr. Chrétien acknowledged that the story was accurate.  Numerous articles followed.  B.The Plain Brown Envelope  [12]On April 5, 2001, Mr. McIntosh received a sealed plain brown envelope at the Ottawa Bureau of theNational Post.  The envelope contained a document that appeared to be a copy of a BDBC internal loan authorization for a $615,000 mortgage to Les Entreprises Yvon Duhaime Inc. (Auberge Grand‑Mère) in August 1997.  On the face of it, the document purported to show that, at the time it applied for and received the loan, Auberge Grand‑Mère listed an outstanding debt of $23,040 to “JAC Consultants”,  a Chrétien family investment company.  Mr. McIntosh concluded that if the document were genuine, it would represent a major escalation in the Shawinigate story.  [13]To check the authenticity of the document, Mr. McIntosh faxed copies to the BDBC, the Prime Minister’s office, and to a lawyer for the Prime Minister.  All three said that the document was a forgery.  The BDBC sent two letters to theNational Poston April 6, 2001.  The first claimed that the BDBC’s records showed no indication of a debt owed to JAC Consultants.  In the second letter, the BDBC warned theNational Postthat bank documents were confidential and should not be disclosed.  A short time after receiving these letters, Mr. McIntosh put the document and its envelope somewhere, he claims, only he is able to access them.  [14]The Bloc Quebecois also received a copy of the BDBC “document” which it photocopied and distributed to its members and others.  The story was picked up by some news sources.  The police believe, however, that only theNational Posthas an envelope and document that could disclose fingerprint or DNA evidence that might in turn lead to identification of the perpetrator(s) and provide physical evidence of the alleged crime(s).  [15]Since it was unable to confirm the document’s authenticity, theNational Posthesitated to publish the allegations.  However, other news organizations published details about the leaked document and the reference to the alleged $23,040 loan and eventually theNational Postpicked up the story and reported that theGlobe and Mail, SunMedia and CTV had already published some details of the alleged bank document, as had theOttawa Citizen.  C.The Modified Undertaking of Confidentiality  [16]Sometime during the week after the receipt of the document, X sought a meeting with Mr. McIntosh, who then consulted legal counsel and editors.  X confirmed that it was he or she who had sent the envelope and asked that it be destroyed.  X expressed concern that the police might try to use it to identify him or her through fingerprint or DNA analysis, and feared that the envelope might link him or her to the bank document now alleged to be a forgery.  Mr. McIntosh testified that he told X “that I would not dispose of them.  I said this would be both improper and highly unethical given the serious allegation that the document had been forged” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 225).  [17]However, as stated earlier, Mr. McIntosh also told X that so long as “I  believed that [X] had not provided the document to deliberately mislead me, my undertaking of confidentiality would remain binding.  I also told Confidential Source X that should irrefutable evidence to the contrary emerge, our agreement of confidentiality would become null and void.  X agreed to these terms” (McIntosh Affidavit, at para. 227).  [18]Mr. McIntosh testified that X explained that he or she had received the document in the mail anonymously and had passed it on to Mr. McIntosh in the belief that it was genuine.  On at least one other occasion, Mr. McIntosh had been able to confirm the authenticity of documents that X claimed to have received in the same way.  In his evidence, Mr. McIntosh said he was satisfied that X was a reliable source and that the loan authorization was genuine.  If the loan authorization was a forgery, Mr. McIntosh did not believe X knew that.  D.The Police Investigation  [19]In the meantime, the BDBC had complained to the RCMP about the alleged forgery.  On June 7, 2001, RCMP Corporal Roland Gallant met with Mr. McIntosh, his editor-in-chief, another editor of theNational Post, and its legal counsel.  Counsel for theNational Postrefused Corporal Gallant’s request to produce the documents.  The police officer was told that before becoming aware of the police investigation, Mr. McIntosh had placed the document and envelope in a secure location not onNational Postpremises.  Mr. McIntosh declined to identify the secret source.  [20]Corporal Gallant indicated that he would have to apply for a search warrant and assistance order in relation to two offences — forgery (creation of a false document with the intent that it be acted upon as genuine) and uttering a forged document (attempting to cause Mr. McIntosh and theNational Postto act on the forged loan authorization as if it were genuine).  TheNational Postexpressed “grave concerns” about the constitutionality of a warrant to disclose a confidential source and requested aninter parteshearing on the warrant application.  E.The Search Warrant and Assistance Order  [21]On July 4, 2002, Corporal Gallant applied to the Ontario Court of Justice for a warrant assistance order stating that the evidence he wished to seize was not available from any other source because the document and envelope formed part of theactus reusof these offences and would be required to substantiate any charges.  He intended to submit the document and envelope for forensic testing to determine if they had “fingerprints or other identifying markings which might assist in identifying the source of the document”.  These other possible identifying markers included saliva, from which a DNA sample could be obtained.  [22]Khawly J. was advised of the desire of theNational Postfor notice and a hearing but decided to proceedex parte.  The search warrant and assistance order were issued without written reasons.  The intended effect of the assistance order was to require the editor-in-chief of theNational Postto assist in locating the two documents in question and to make them available to Corporal Gallant.  [23]In relation to procedural protection, the terms of the orders attempted to accommodate the special position of the media.  It was provided that the orders were to be served on July 5, 2002.  The appellants would thereafter be given  a month to consider their position.  On August 9, 2002 (or such earlier date as the appellants agreed to) Corporal Gallant was again to attend at the offices of theNational Postand request production of the BDBC loan authorization and the “associated” brown envelope.  The warrant then provided that after waiting two hours (to give the appellants an opportunity for voluntary compliance without prejudice to any subsequent challenge they might see fit to make to the issuance or execution of the warrant) the police officer would then be free to search theNational Postpremises.  The police were directed to interfere “as little as possible with the operations of the place being searched and avoid, to the extent possible, examining any notes, documents, records or lists unconnected with securing the location of the things subject to seizure”.  If found, the documents would on request be marked for identification and sealed in a package and delivered for safekeeping to the Ontario Court of Justice.  The appellants would then have 14 days to apply “for the continued sealing and return of any things sealed”.  [24]The appellants duly applied to quash the warrant and assistance order.  Relying upon a considerably amplified record which included the cross-examination of Mr. McIntosh and the filing of 15 affidavits from experienced journalists on the use and importance of secret sources, Benotto J., the reviewing judge, concluded that while there was “sufficient information to conclude the document was a forgery” (para. 22), there was “only a remote and speculative possibility that the fingerprints were those of the alleged forgerer” and “[d]isclosure of the document will minimally, if at all, advance the investigation while at the same time damage freedom of expression” (para. 79). Accordingly, she set aside the search warrant and assistance order.  Her decision was reversed by the Ontario Court of Appeal on February 29, 2008 in reasons jointly authored by Justices Laskin and Simmons (2008 ONCA 139, 89 O.R. (3d) 1).  References will be made in what follows to the reasons of the reviewing judge and the Court of Appeal. "

The complainant, R.S., was born on March 12, 1979, and disclosed the sexual occurrences in March of 1988.  In May 1988, following a medical examination of the complainant, the police began an investigation of the allegations.  In August 1988, a videotape interview of the complainant took place.  The complainant, a female child who was nine years old at the time of the videotaping, indicated that the respondent, her grandfather, had put his hand inside her \"privates\" and had touched her \"chest\".  She further indicated that this had happened \"lots of times\".  R.S. also mentioned that the respondent had warned her not to tell anybody or else he would hurt her.  The respondent was charged in October 1988.  At the preliminary inquiry, held in May and June 1989, the complainant testified before the court.  At the trial, held in November and December 1989, the Crown sought to introduce the videotaped interview of the complainant, pursuant to the dispositions of 715.1 of theCriminal Code.  The respondent moved for a declaration that s. 715.1 was unconstitutional as it contravened ss. 7 and 11(d) of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.  The trial judge dismissed the motion, upholding the constitutionality of s. 715.1.  Following avoir dire, at which the complainant, her mother and the sergeant involved in making the videotape testified, the videotaped interview was admitted into evidence.  The trial judge convicted the respondent on one count of sexual assault.  No verdict was entered with respect to the count of sexual interference by application of theKienappleprinciple.  The other counts of sexual assault related to two other complainants.  On June 18, 1991, the Court of Appeal for Manitoba allowed the respondent D.O.L.'s appeal against conviction and declareds. 715.1of theCriminal Codeunconstitutional: (1991), 73 Man. R.

        "Facts": " 2The respondent Marijana Ruzic was born in Belgrade in the former Yugoslavia.  She was 21 years old when she entered Canada.  When heroin was discovered on her, she was charged with three offences, two of which proceeded to trial:  possession and use of a false passport contrary tos. 368of theCriminal Code, and unlawful importation of a narcotic contrary to s. 5(1) of theNarcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-1.  3Ms. Ruzic admitted having committed both offences but claimed that she was then acting under duress and should thus be relieved from any criminal liability.  She testified that, two months before her arrival in Canada, a man named Mirko Mirkovic approached her while she was walking her dog in the streets of Belgrade, where she lived in an apartment with her mother.  She described him as a “warrior” and believed he was paid to kill people in the war.  An expert witness testified at trial that, in 1994, large paramilitary groups roamed Belgrade and engaged in criminal and mafia-like activities.  The same expert maintained that people living in Belgrade during that period did not feel safe.  They believed the police could not be trusted.  There was a real sense that the rule of law had broken down.  4From there began a series of encounters between Mirkovic and the respondent while she was walking her dog.  Each time he approached her, he knew more about her, although she had shared no details of her life with him.  He phoned her at home.  He told her he knew her every move.  Ms. Ruzic alleged that his behaviour became more and more intimidating, escalating to threats and acts of physical violence.  On one occasion, he burned her arm with a lighter.  On another, he stuck a syringe into her arm and injected her with a substance that smelled like heroin and made her nauseous.  She indicated that these physical assaults were coupled with sexual harassment and finally threats against her mother.  5On April 25, 1994, Mirkovic phoned the respondent and instructed her to pack a bag and meet him at a hotel in central Belgrade.  Once there, he allegedly strapped three packages of heroin to her body and indicated that she was to take them to a restaurant in Toronto.  He gave her the false passport, a bus ticket from Belgrade to Budapest and some money.  He told her to fly from Budapest to Athens, and then from Athens to Toronto.  When she protested, he warned her that, if she failed to comply, he would harm her mother.  6Ms. Ruzic arrived in Budapest on April 26.  Late that evening, she boarded a plane to Athens, where she arrived early the next day.  She then purchased a ticket to Toronto.  She missed that flight, exchanged her ticket for the next available flight, and left for Toronto two days later, on April 29.  7During the two months prior to her journey to Canada, Ms. Ruzic testified that she did not tell her mother or anyone else about Mirkovic.  She was afraid he would harm whoever she told.  She did not seek police protection because she believed the police in Belgrade were corrupt and would do nothing to assist her.  She maintained that she followed Mirkovic’s instructions out of fear for her mother’s safety.  She made no attempt while in Budapest or Athens to seek the assistance of police or other government officials.  Similarly, before her arrest, she did not ask any Canadian authorities for help.  She asserted that she believed the only way she could protect her mother was to obey Mirkovic’s orders.

        "Facts": " The appellant was convicted with four others (Scibetta, Criminisi, Vanderkooy, and Allen) of conspiring to import a narcotic (cocaine).  The principal evidence consisted of: (a) intercepted private communications, many of which were between Garofoli in Hamilton and Frank Savasta in Florida; (b) the evidence of Earl Smith, who was employed by Savasta to transport three kilograms of cocaine from Florida to Hamilton in November 1983; (c) the evidence of Biebuyck, as to the purchase by Vanderkooy of a quantity of cocaine in November or December 1983, and the subsequent sale and the delivery of certain of the proceeds to Scibetta; and (d) evidence confirming the presence of Smith in Hamilton in November 1983 and Savasta in Hamilton in January 1984.  The Court of Appeal held that the jury would be warranted in finding the following facts.  Garofoli in Hamilton arranged with Savasta in Florida to purchase three kilograms of cocaine.  On November 20, 1983, Criminisi and Allen flew to Florida and paid Savasta $20,000 of a total price of $61,000 for three kilograms of cocaine.  Criminisi rented a car, and the cocaine was placed in its spare tire.  Smith and Allen drove the car to Buffalo where Smith was to collect the balance of the purchase price.  Smith and Allen registered at a hotel in Buffalo, and were joined by Scibetta.  It was decided that Smith would drive the car across the border.  After crossing the border, Smith and Allen drove to a hotel in Hamilton where they registered as guests early in the morning of November 23.  Later that morning, Criminisi and Scibetta joined them at the hotel.  Scibetta removed the spare tire from the rental car's trunk, put it in his car, and drove away.  Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to the M & R Auto Body Shop, and met Garofoli and others.  The car was stored there, with the Florida licence plates removed.  Smith remained in Hamilton, attempting to collect the balance of the purchase price.  Around November 27 Criminisi paid him a further $10,000.  A few days later, Smith, Criminisi and Allen went to Garofoli's home to discuss the balance.  They telephoned Savasta at his office in Florida from a nearby pay telephone.  Criminisi spoke first to Savasta.  Then Garofoli spoke to Savasta, telling him he could be trusted to pay the balance.  While speaking to Savasta, he gave $4,790 to Criminisi which he gave to Smith.  Then Smith spoke to Savasta who told him to return to Florida.  In late November or in early December 1983, Vanderkooy and Biebuyck drove to the M & R Body Shop.  Vanderkooy went in, returned with Scibetta, and pointed to his car.  Vanderkooy and Biebuyck left, and returned about one half-hour later.  Vanderkooy again went into the shop.  He returned and drove to Biebuyck's home, where he removed a package containing a kilogram of cocaine from the trunk of his car.  The cocaine was divided into one-ounce packages.  Most of it was sold, with certain of the proceeds being turned over to Scibetta.  After Smith returned to Florida, there were several telephone calls from Savasta to Garofoli concerning payment of the money.  In January 1984 Savasta came to Hamilton where he met with Garofoli.  During the investigation, there were four orders authorizing the interception of the private communications.   They were granted September 26, September 29, November 21 and December 30, 1983, by judges of the High Court of Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario.  The evidence of Garofoli's involvement in the conspiracy is derived in large measure from private communications intercepted under these authorizations.  These included telephone conversations which ostensibly referred to the importing of various automobiles and jewelry, but which the jury were invited to interpret as referring to cocaine.  At the conclusion of avoir direto determine the admissibility of the intercepted communications, the trial judge refused to order the opening of the sealed packets containing the affidavits upon which the orders were obtained and ordered that the wiretap evidence was admissible.  The appellant did not appear for the next day of the trial.  The trial was adjourned while inquiries were made as to his whereabouts.  When it appeared that there was no explanation for his absence, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.  Pursuant to s. 431.1 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.C-34, the trial judge made a finding that he had absconded and ordered that the trial continue in his absence.  The appellant's counsel was permitted to withdraw at that point.  The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario against his conviction and sentence on numerous grounds.  It dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against sentence.

        "Facts": " The appellant was convicted of the first degree murder of Lisa Clark, who died of skull injuries and whose body had been burned.  The Crown's theory was that the victim's death was caused while the appellant attempted to commit a sexual assault.  In support of this theory, the Crown led the evidence of a fellow prisoner who testified that while in prison the appellant told him that he had run down the victim with his car as she was attempting to escape from his sexual advances and then stripped her body and burned it.  Another witness testified that the appellant denied making any sexual advances or assault upon the victim, stating that she had fallen accidentally while helping him push‑start his car, after which, in a panic, he burned her body.  The trial judge told the jury that in order to find the appellant guilty of first degree murder, they must find that murder was committed while committing a sexual assault or attempting to commit a sexual assault.  The trial judge charged the jury on ss. 212 and 213 in relation to murder.  The jury returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder.

        "Facts": " The appellant was at all material times a Constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. On August 21, 1981, one Donald Kerr was brought to the R.C.M.P. detachment in Yorkton, Saskatch‑ ewan for a breathalyzer test. Kerr was taken into a room where he met the appellant.  The appellant started to question Kerr concerning the incident giving rise to his arrest. He asked Kerr who was driving the car at the time. Kerr indicated that his sister was driving. The appellant suspected he was lying. He repeated the question a couple of times, receiving the same response each time. The appellant then grabbed Kerr, who was seated in a chair at the time, by the throat and pushed him against a wall. The grab around the throat was sufficient to cause a choking sensation to Kerr.  After a few seconds the appellant questioned Kerr again as to who was driving the car. Kerr continued to maintain that his sister was driving. The appellant slapped Kerr across the face with his open hand and repeated the question. Kerr gave the same answer. However, after three or four slaps Kerr admitted that he had been driving the car. At no time did Kerr respond physically to the appellant's slaps. The defence has admitted, on these facts, that the appellant committed a common assault as defined in theCriminal Code. As a result of the assault Kerr suffered a sore throat, a ringing in his ears, and several minor marks on his face.  Two charges were laid following this incident. On August 21, 1981 the appellant was charged with common assault contrary to s. 245(1) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. The appellant was also charged under theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Actas follows:  That at or near Yorkton, in the Province of Saskatchewan, on the 21st day of August, 1981, that you were unnecessarily violent towards a prisoner, to wit: Donald Kerr, by forcibly grabbing him and slapping him in the face, contrary to Section [sic] (L), Section 25 of theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police Act.

            "The other major issue on appeal related to the sufficiency of the jury charge, and in particular the judge's instructions on the offence of murder. The majority of the Appeal Division concluded that the charge could not have confused the jury on the issue of the requisite intent for first and second degree murder.  It also rejected the argument that the judge's reference to criminal negligence in the charge required a new trial.  While the reference was unnecessary, the majority was satisfied that reading the charge as a whole, the jury could not have been confused on the essential issues -- provocation and drunkenness.  Additional objections, including those relating to the trial judge's treatment of provocation and his instructions on weighing evidence and assessing credibility, were held to be without merit.  Jones J.A. concluded (at p. 113):",
            "With respect to the trial judge's instructions on murder, Macdonald J.A. stated that, in his view, the charge could have given the jury the mistaken impression that criminal negligence would support a charge of murder and thus was erroneous.  As to provocation, Macdonald J.A. also was of the view that the trial judge at one point misdirected the jury as to what provocation means in law.  Concluding, however, that the appellant suffered no prejudice as a result of the misdirection on provocation, since the trial judge told the jury that in his view provocation did exist, Macdonald J.A. applied the curative provision of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 , with respect to that error.  As to the first error in the charge, Macdonald J.A. stated that he was not convinced that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the error had not occurred and thus did not invoke s. 686(1)(b)(iii) with respect to the criminal negligence reference."

        "Facts": " On June 13, 1988, Norman Smith, a fisherman, killed his friend, Larry Goreham, with a shotgun.  Smith and Goreham had been drinking with two other men, Earl Hopkins and Ronald Hines, in Goreham's barn.  After several hours of drinking an argument erupted between Smith and Hopkins, apparently over their respective abilities as fishermen.  The fight became physical.  While there is some dispute about exactly what happened, there is no doubt that Smith was beaten quite badly as a result of the altercation.  According to Hines, he left the barn pointing his finger at the other men and saying: \"I'll get you all.\"  Smith denies this.  Smith returned ten to fifteen minutes later with his loaded 12-gauge shotgun.  Upon hearing Smith's vehicle, Hopkins looked out the window to see Smith holding the gun.  Smith fired, shattering a barn window.  Hopkins ducked out of the way.  Goreham was less wise; appearing at the upper doors of the barn, he began taunting Smith.  Smith fired.  The shot struck Goreham on the face and chest, and he fell back and died.  Investigation established that the gun was fired at a distance of about 96 feet and that there were 169 pellet holes in Goreham's body.  Smith got in his vehicle and went home.  Substituting a rifle and ammunition for his shotgun, he proceeded to his sister's residence, where he spent the night.  Early the next morning he telephoned the police, and at 6:00 a.m. the police came to arrest him.  When Smith walked out of the house to surrender, he was met by three officers covering him with rifles; he was directed to his knees, handcuffed and placed in the rear of a police vehicle.  In the police vehicle, Constable Terry Faye advised Smith that he was under arrest \"for a shooting incident at the residence of Larry Goreham\".  Constable Faye then instructed Smith that \"[you have] the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay\".  The officer asked Smith if he understood what that meant and he replied: \"It means I can get a lawyer doesn't it?\"  The officer answered: \"Yes, it does\".  Constable Faye then provided Smith with the standard police warning and asked him if he understood the warning.  Smith replied: \"I can tell you fellas what went on or I don't have to\".  The officer then advised Smith to say nothing until they reached the police station.  Smith arrived at the R.C.M.P. detachment in Barrington, Shelburne County, Nova Scotia, at 6:25 a.m.  Once inside an interview room, Constable Faye stated: \"I just want to refresh your memory back there in the car about what I told you.  First of all, I told you you were under arrest and that you could contact a lawyer.  Lastly, I read you the police warning and you said that you understood that.  Norman, do you want the opportunity to exercise those rights about anything I have said to you so far?\"  Smith responded: \"No\".  The officer then said to Smith, \"O.K. Norman I'd like to get your side of the story.  We've heard the other side and I think it's only fair that we get your side.\"  Between 6:33 a.m. and 7:47 a.m. the police then took a statement from Smith, in which Smith admitted the shooting but sought to explain it on the grounds of drunkenness and provocation.  While the statement was being taken, Constable Faye was able to detect a very slight odour of alcohol on Smith's breath.  He also observed that Smith's left eye was almost completely swollen shut and that there was some bruising on his face.  During the interview, Constable Faye also became aware that Smith did not know that Mr. Goreham had died.  The police had only told Smith that he was being arrested for \"a shooting incident\".  Although the police knew that they were investigating a murder, at no time during the interrogation did they inform Smith of this fact.  Smith was not informed of Goreham's death until some time after 8:37 a.m., after Smith had finished his statement and had been fingerprinted, photographed and placed in a cell.  At that time, Constable Faye also told Smith that he would be discussing the matter with the Crown prosecutor but that Smith should \"think the worst\".  Smith was charged with first degree murder.  At trial, after avoir direat which the appellant testified, the appellant's statement was held to be admissible in evidence.  Smith also testified at trial in support of the defences of drunkenness and provocation.  In charging the jury, the trial judge provided instruction with respect to both the elements of first and second degree murder and the meaning of planning and deliberation.  Prior to defining murder, the trial judge also instructed the jury on the matter of criminal negligence and stated that pointing a loaded shotgun at someone while drunk is criminal negligence.  On the question of provocation, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they found that the appellant had the capacity to form the requisite intent, they could convict Smith for murder, subject to their consideration of the defence of provocation.  The jury returned with a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.

        "Facts": " The appellant was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 246.1 (now s. 271) of theCriminal Code.  The charge arises from an incident which occurred in the early morning hours of December 1, 1984.  The appellant was arrested later that day.  Two police officers attended at his home where he resided with his parents.  Upon arrest, the appellant was informed of his right to counsel.  Immediately after this, his father, Mr. Bain, told him not to say anything until he had seen a lawyer.  While his son got dressed in preparation to accompany the police, Mr. Bain, with the help of one of the police officers, attempted to retain a lawyer by looking through the Yellow Pages.  After being unsuccessful with two or three numbers, the police officer gave him a business card with his telephone number on it.  He told Mr. Bain that when a lawyer had been retained, the lawyer should call the officer at the number on the card.  The appellant then left with the officers.  After both officers returned to the car, they drove off with the appellant and parked down the street.  The police officers updated their notebooks and were discussing between themselves what had occurred in the house.  According to one of the officer's (McIntyre) testimony in chief, the appellant initiated an inculpatory conversation.  During his testimony on thevoir dire, the appellant denied making some of these statements; in particular, he denied making the inculpatory admissions.  Upon arrival at the police station, the appellant was placed alone in an interview room.  About 25 minutes later, a lawyer who had been retained by Mr. Bain called for the police officer.  McIntyre returned the telephone call 10 minutes later.  The lawyer told McIntyre that he had been retained by the appellant's parents on behalf of the appellant.  McIntyre informed the lawyer of the circumstances of the investigation and of the alleged sexual assault and told the lawyer that the appellant would probably be released later that day.  The lawyer could not attend at the police station that day so he simply told McIntyre not to take any statement from the appellant until he, the lawyer, was present.  On the stand, the lawyer could not remember whether he had asked to speak to the appellant.  Following this telephone conversation, McIntyre (and another officer, Chisholm) went into the interview room with the appellant.  According to the appellant's testimony, he asked  whether his father had called. McIntyre told him that his father had not called.  The appellant said that he wanted to contact his father to find out if his father had retained a lawyer.  McIntyre told the appellant that he could call his father later.  At no time did McIntyre tell the appellant about the telephone call from the lawyer.  The police officers initiated an interrogation of the appellant.  The appellant told the officers that he was very impaired the previous night due to the intake of a considerable amount of alcohol as well as one \"hit\" of L.S.D.  The officers then questioned the appellant about his prior relationship with the complainant.  He was also questioned about his interaction with the complainant on the night in question.  On April 21, 1987, the appellant was tried before a judge and jury in Brampton, Ontario, on a charge of sexual assault.  Following arraignment, but before the first prospective juror was asked to step forward, appellant's counsel sought a ruling that both the Crown and the defence each be limited to four peremptory challenges and that the Crown be denied the power to stand jurors by.  The trial judge made the requested ruling based on his own holdings to the same effect in other cases.  He considered himself bound by his own ruling \"until the Court of Appeal rules otherwise\".  The Crown's objection was noted.  The jurors were then selected with both the defence and the Crown exercising their four peremptory challenges.  Following a 14-day trial, the jury acquitted the appellant.  On January 31, 1989, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal ((1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 250) and ordered a new trial.  The appellant appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada as of right. "

N-1.  A bail hearing was held shortly after his arrest.  Pearson was denied bail and ordered detained in custody until trial.  Shortly thereafter, a preliminary inquiry was held and Pearson was committed to trial.  At the end of the preliminary inquiry, Pearson brought an application to the preliminary inquiry judge unders. 523(2)(b) of theCriminal Codeto review the order that he remain in custody until trial.  The preliminary inquiry judge refused to review this order.  Pearson then brought an application forhabeas corpus.  He argued thats. 515(6)(d) of theCriminal Codeis unconstitutional, and that accordingly his detention was illegal.  Thehabeas corpusapplication was heard by Biron J. of the Quebec Superior Court on November 17, 1989.  At the outset of the hearing, the Attorney General of Canada obtained leave to intervene in the application and moved to dismiss the application on the ground that there was an alternative remedy, namely a review of the bail order unders. 520of theCriminal Code.  Biron J. granted this motion and dismissed Pearson's application.  Pearson appealed.  On September 10, 1990, the Quebec Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding thathabeas corpuswas an available remedy in the circumstances and thats. 515(6)(d) of theCriminal Codeviolatesss. 9,11(d)and11(e)of theCharter:  [1990] R.J.Q. 2438, 59 C.C.C.

The Attorney General of Quebec now appeals to this Court.  The Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General for Ontario and the Attorney General for Saskatchewan have intervened in support of the position taken by the Attorney General of Quebec.  The Criminal Lawyers' Association has intervened in support of the position taken by the respondent.

Some time after this request, in September of the same year, the security staff at a major downtown hotel contacted the police with information relating to the possible use of their premises for illegal gaming.  On September 17, the officers in charge of the gambling investigation went to the hotel and attended at a recently vacated room.  There the officers found that the occupants of the room had rearranged the furniture in order to form a long table suitable for gambling.  In addition, on searching the garbage the occupants had left behind, the police found many slips of paper bearing Chinese characters.  The slips bore the address and number of the hotel room, and the chief investigating officer was able to identify these notices as similar to some which he knew were distributed to potential Oriental gamblers in various restaurants in Toronto's Chinatown area.  The police checked the hotel register and discovered that the appellant, Santiago Wong, had booked this room for the 19th and 20th of the same month.  On the basis of their findings of the 17th, the police concluded that the room booked by the appellant might be used for illegal gambling.  After determining that it would not be feasible to see into the room from the roof of the other wing of the hotel, the officers in charge of the investigation concluded that only video surveillance would enable them to further their investigation by actually monitoring what transpired in the room booked by the appellant.  Notably, the police rejected the idea of employing undercover officers.  On the basis of past experience, they were certain that the gaming would be conducted behind locked doors, by and for Orientals alone.  Since the identity of Oriental police officers was well known in the community, the investigating officers concluded it would be virtually impossible to infiltrate the gambling sessions with undercover operators.  Once it was determined that video surveillance was the only feasible way of monitoring what went on in the room, the officers contacted the Metro Police Intelligence Branch and a Crown Counsel to discuss the possibility of obtaining a warrant.  These discussions left the police officers with the impression that it would not be possible to obtain judicial authorization to conduct the video surveillance.  The investigators therefore decided to proceed without this authorization, and on September 19 the police installed a video camera in the drapery valence of the room that was registered to Mr. Wong.  The camera had a lens about the size of the lead of a pencil and was attached to simultaneous recording equipment which the police monitored from an adjacent hotel room.  The police installed this equipment with the permission and co‑operation of the hotel management.  The police monitored the activities in the rooms on five separate occasions.  These observations left no doubt that illegal gambling sessions were being held in the hotel suite.  This surveillance culminated in a raid in the early morning hours of October 1, 1984.  The police entered the room with a key provided by management and found a large group of Oriental males in the suite.  A search of these persons revealed numerous slips of the type seized in the initial search of September 17.  The appellant was found to be in possession of profit lists, while debt lists were seized from some of the other occupants of the room.  The police were also able to seize gambling paraphernalia and a large amount of money found lying on the gaming table.  The appellant and ten other accused were later charged with the offence of keeping a common gaming house.  At trial, all the accused pleaded not guilty.  On September 11, 1985, the trial judge dismissed the charges against all those concerned.  He held the video surveillance of the accused to be a violation ofs. 8of theCharter, and excluded the evidence thereby obtained unders. 24(2)of theCharter.  On March 20, 1987, the Crown's appeal to the Court of Appeal against the acquittal of the appellant and the other accused was allowed, and a new trial ordered ((1987), 19 O.A.C. 365).  In a judgment to which I shall later have occasion to refer, Cory J.A., as he then was, writing for a unanimous court, held that surreptitious video surveillance would constitute a search and seizure within the meaning ofs. 8of theCharterin circumstances where the person observed by the camera had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  However, he went on to conclude that on the facts of this case the appellant could not be said to have had a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held,s. 8of theCharterhad no application and the evidence of the video surveillance was therefore admissible.

On February 7, 1985 the bodies of James McLean and Ann McLean were found in the bathroom of their home, a trailer, in Valleyview, Alberta.  A police investigation led to Martineau and one Patrick Tremblay.  Martineau, who was fifteen at the time, was charged with both murders and was transferred to adult court.  Martineau was tried by a judge and jury starting on September 12, 1985.  Thirty witnesses gave evidence including the accused.  The evidence revealed that Martineau and his friend, Tremblay, had set out one evening armed with a pellet pistol and rifle respectively.  Martineau testified that he knew that they were going to commit a crime, but that he thought it would only be a \"b and e\".  After robbing the trailer and its occupants, Martineau's friend Tremblay shot and killed the McLeans.  As they left the trailer, Martineau asked Tremblay why he killed them and Tremblay answered, \"they saw our faces\".  Martineau responded, \"But they couldn't see mine 'cause I had a mask on\".  They drove James McLean's car to Grande Prairie where they abandoned it.   The respondent was convicted of second degree murder.  The trial judge charged the jury ons. 213(a) and (d) of theCriminal Codeand ons. 21(1)and(2)of theCriminal Code.

        "Facts": " 3The appellant, Mr. Latimer, was the father of Tracy Latimer, a severely disabled child who died at her family farm on Sunday, October 24, 1993.  Tracy suffered from extreme cerebral palsy and was quadriplegic.  As a result of her physical condition,  she was largely immobile and bedridden, and was physically unable to take care of herself.  Her family provided her with constant care.  Eating was a difficult task, and Tracy had to be spoon fed.  Unfortunately, even with this assistance, she could not consume a sufficient amount of nutrients, and as a result experienced weight loss.  4It is undisputed that Tracy was in constant pain.  The evidence traces this pain to an operation  that Tracy underwent in 1990 to balance the muscles around her pelvis, and another operation in 1992 to reduce the abnormal curvature in her back. Although the latter surgery was successful, it led to the dislocation of her right hip, which caused considerable discomfort.  As well, despite the administration of medication, Tracy experienced five to six seizures every day.  5Tracy was in the care of Mr. Latimer when she passed away.  The appellant had remained home to care for Tracy, while Tracy’s mother and siblings were at church to attend a Sunday service.  Tracy was found by Mrs. Latimer at approximately 1:30 p.m., when she went to get Tracy for lunch.  At 2:00 p.m., Mr. Latimer advised the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP by telephone that Tracy had passed away in her sleep.  The RCMP officer who took the call and the local coroner attended at the Latimer farm.  While at the farm, the coroner examined Tracy’s body in order to determine the cause of death.  Finding no evidence to suggest suffocation, the coroner arranged for an autopsy.  During the visit to the farm, Mr. Latimer maintained that Tracy had passed away in her sleep.  He stated that Tracy had been in pain and put to bed at about 12:30 p.m.  6The autopsy found no signs that would explain Tracy’s death, but found signs consistent with poisoning.  Samples of Tracy’s blood were therefore sent to a forensic laboratory for further analysis.  Tests indicated that Tracy’s blood was saturated with carbon monoxide.  Because of the high levels of carbon monoxide in Tracy’s blood, the RCMP began to treat the matter as a homicide investigation.  7The members of the Wilkie detachment of the RCMP inferred the possibility of motive and opportunity from the facts before them — the appellant was alone with Tracy at the time of her death, and Tracy was bedridden and in constant pain.  They then decided to seek the assistance of the General Investigation Section at North Battleford, representatives of which they met with on Wednesday, November 3, 1993.  As a result of that meeting, members of the North Battleford detachment decided to attend at the Latimer farm, take Mr. Latimer into custody, interview his wife and execute a search warrant.  8This plan was put into effect the next day, on Thursday, November 4, 1993.  The events are described in the uncontradicted testimony of one of the principal investigators, Corporal Lyons, which is quoted in the trial judgment.  Important portions of that testimony, which are central to the disposition of this appeal, are underlined for emphasis:  At 8:28 that morning, Sergeant Conlon and I went to the residence.  . . .  We went to the door, we rapped on it, waited a couple of minutes.  Robert Latimer came to the door.  He was — appeared to have just been in the process of getting up, he was in a housecoat, hair messed a little bit.  Sergeant Conlon introduced ourselves to him, identified us, of course.  We shook hands.  Sergeant Conlon told him that we were from North Battleford and were assisting Wilkie in the investigation of Tracy’s death, being his daughter, and told Mr. Latimer that we’d like to speak to him.  He went into a bedroom and got dressed, came out a couple of minutes later.  We were waiting in the kitchen.  Sergeant Conlon said that we’d like to speak to him outside.  There was no response.  He put on his -- put on his rubber boots and a jacket and went outside to the car with us.  We had an unmarked police vehicle . . . I went into the driver’s seat, Sergeant Conlon the passenger side, and Mr. Latimer in the back seat behind me.  . . . "

[112]On December 13, 2003, D.B., who was 17 at the time, went to a shopping mall in Hamilton with some friends.  They began exchanging insults with another group of young men and two of them decided to fight.  When the fight between those two began outside the mall, D.B. turned to Jonathan Romero and said “Me and you are going to fight right now”.  Romero said “No”.  Romero was watching the others fight with his arms down at his sides when D.B. punched him on the right side of his neck and face area.   The punch was described as a “sucker punch” meaning that Romero was neither prepared nor ready for the punch.  Romero fell to the ground from the force of D.B.’s punch.  D.B. then continued the assault by jumping on top of Romero and punching him four more times on the face and neck.  Romero was knocked unconscious and unable to defend himself.  [113]D.B. then fled back towards the shopping mall.  The two other combatants stopped fighting and, along with three employees of a nearby store, came to the aid of the victim.  An ambulance was called.  When it arrived, Romero had no vital signs.  Romero later died of his injuries.  [114]Inside the shopping mall, D.B. was heard to say:  “You missed it, it was one punch, the guy’s not even fuckin’ moving.”  D.B. changed his clothes in a nearby restaurant, stowed the old clothes in a knapsack and gave the knapsack to another person.  He then went to the home of one of his friends, talking about the fight on the way.  Later that evening, D.B. went to a nightclub.  He left with some friends in a taxi around closing time.  [115]In the taxi, D.B. learned via cellular telephone that Romero had died.  He stayed the night at the home of one of his friends.  When the police arrived at the friend’s home the following morning, D.B. attempted to flee out the back door, but was subsequently caught and arrested.  [116]D.B. pleaded guilty and was convicted of manslaughter.  He made an application to receive a youth sentence, which was opposed by the Crown.  [117]D.B. had had frequent physical altercations with peers and had been suspended from high school numerous times, primarily for disruptive behaviour, verbal aggression, and disrespectful and intimidating conduct towards school staff.  At the time of the offence, D.B. was bound by two separate probation orders, arising out of prior convictions for possession of stolen property and robbery.  Both offences involved threats and intimidation.  While he was in custody awaiting disposition and sentence for manslaughter, D.B. was involved in several assaultive incidents with other inmates and staff members (see Predisposition Assessment, Appellant’s Record, at pp. 184-85).  [118]As a result of the Crown opposing his youth sentence application, D.B. challenged the constitutionality of the presumptive offence provisions of theYCJA.  The sentencing judge allowed theCharterchallenge ((2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 605 (S.C.J.)).  He imposed a youth sentence of 30 months in a juvenile correctional facility.  The Crown appealed to the Ontario Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal, holding that the presumptive offence provisions violateds. 7of theCharterand were not saved under s. 1 ((2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 698). "

On May 9, 1985 the trial judge ruled on a motion made by the appellants and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel for a trial by a judge alone.  The trial judge held that the effect ofs. 11(f)of theCharterwas to allow the accused to elect whether to be tried by a judge and jury or by a judge alone.  He also ruled thatss. 427,428and429of theCriminal Codeviolateds. 15of theCharterbecause s. 430 gave individuals charged with the same offence in Alberta an election to be tried by a judge alone.  All three forthwith elected to be tried by a judge alone and the trial proceeded.  On July 25, 1985 the trial judge acquitted the appellant Sharon Turpin and convicted the appellant Latif Siddiqui and the co-accused Whitley Clauzel of second degree murder.  The Crown appealed and on August 20, 1987 the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on the ground that the trial judge had conducted the trial without jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeal set aside the verdicts and ordered a new trial for first degree murder for all three accused.  The appellants appealed to this Court as of right pursuant to s. 618(2) of theCriminal Code.

            "Under the doctrine of abuse of process, the unfair or oppressive treatment of an appellant disentitles the Crown to carry on with the prosecution of the charge.  The prosecution is set aside, not on the merits (see Jewitt, supra, at p. 148), but because it is tainted to such a degree that to allow it to proceed would tarnish the integrity of the court.  The doctrine is one of the safeguards designed to ensure \"that the repression of crime through the conviction of the guilty is done in a way which reflects our fundamental values as a society\" (Rothman v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 640, at p. 689, per Lamer J.)  It acknowledges that courts must have the respect and support of the community in order that the administration of criminal justice may properly fulfil its function.  Consequently, where the affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal cases, then the administration of justice is best served by staying the proceedings.",

C.A.), at p. 293, appeal dismissed, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296).  Proceeding on the footing that the applicable provisions of the Code were valid, the Crown objected to the proposed re-election on the ground that any such re-election would have been contrary to ss. 429  and 430  of the Criminal Code .  Such conduct does not in my view take the Crown's adversarial position too far.  The Crown was entitled to conduct the prosecution on the basis that the applicable dispositions of the Criminal Code  were constitutionally valid.",

        "Facts": " On August 29, 1982, during the course of a bonfire party, a fight occurred between the appellant Conway and one Warren Leach.  The appellant was then 21 years of age.  There had been a history of animosity between the appellant and Leach.  Leach was stabbed sixteen times and died as a result of these injuries.  Later that same day, the appellant was arrested on a charge of first degree murder in connection with Leach's death.  The appellant was detained in custody until September 13, 1982, at which time he was granted judicial interim release.  The preliminary hearing was held in part on January 12 and 13, 1983, and was continued and concluded four months later on May 9 and 19, 1983 when the original two days scheduled in January proved insufficient to complete the inquiry.  The appellant was committed to stand trial on the charge of first degree murder.  On June 24, 1983, the trial was adjourned on consent until December 5, 1983 to deal with the appellant's application to quash the committal for first degree murder.  The application was dismissed, and on September 13, 1983 the trial date of December 6, 1983 was confirmed.  Shortly thereafter, almost 16 months after the charge, on December 15, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty of first degree murder but guilty of the lesser included offence of second degree murder.  The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment without eligibility of parole for ten years.  The appellant was represented at this trial by Mr. Leonard Shore.  The appellant launched an appeal of his conviction which was heard in December 1984.  The appellant was represented by Mr. Brian Greenspan.  On January 24, 1985, the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal partly on the grounds that the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury relating to provocation.   A new trial was ordered.  The appellant was in custody for over thirteen months between December 14, 1983 and February 1, 1985.  On the later date he was released on bail.  The appellant appeared in Assignment Court on March 4, 1985 and, upon adjournment, again on June 25, 1985, at which time a date for the second trial was set for January 7, 1986.  On November 15, 1985, counsel who had represented the appellant during his first trial, Mr. Shore, brought an application to be removed from the record.  The appellant was in the process of retaining Mr. Greenspan to conduct the second trial.  Mr. Shore's  application was refused by Osborne J. due to a concern that new counsel would be unable to prepare by January 7, 1986.  However, Mr. Shore applied again on December 5, 1985, and this time his application to be removed from the record was granted by Osborne J.  On December 10, 1985, Osborne J. further directed that the trial was to proceed on January 7, 1986.  This left the appellant one month to obtain new counsel before the second trial.  Conway did not succeed in obtaining new counsel and appeared unrepresented at the scheduled start of his second trial on January 7, 1986.  The appellant gave Osborne J. at this time a list of 11 criminal lawyers including Mr. Greenspan who had stated they could not take the case due to the short time before the trial date.  Although the Crown and the court expressed some concern at the delay, the matter was adjourned to April 21, 1986 in order to allow the appellant to retain new counsel.  The second trial began on April 21, 1986 with Mr. Greenspan acting as counsel for the appellant.  On May 1, 1986, after two days of deliberations, the jury failed to reach a verdict and a mistrial was declared.  The matter again came up in Assignment Court on May 26, 1986. The appellant was unrepresented but a lawyer from Mr. Shore's office spoke on his behalf.  Mr. Greenspan had indicated to the accused that it would not be possible for him to act as counsel again in proceedings held in Ottawa.  There was an adjournment until June 16, 1986 in order to enable the appellant to attend with counsel to fix a date for the third trial.  At that time, although Mr. Shore spoke on his behalf, the appellant still had not retained counsel.  A trial date was nevertheless set for September 22, 1986.  A change of venue application to move the proceedings to Toronto brought by Mr. Greenspan was dismissed on August 8, 1986.  After the second trial the appellant applied for assistance under the Ontario Legal Aid Plan.  This application had been made prior to the appellant's appearance on June 16, 1986 to set a date for trial.  However, Conway had not been granted Legal Aid by the time of the June 16 appearance.  After being refused twice, the appellant was finally granted Legal Aid on certain financial conditions in July of 1986.  On the date set for the third trial, September 22, 1986, the appellant sought an adjournment as he had not been successful in retaining new counsel.  The request was granted over the objection of the Crown and the trial was set for November 10, 1986.  On October 2, 1986, the accused brought an application to adjourn the trial date as Donald Bayne, the new counsel, was only able to represent the appellant if an adjournment were granted.  The application was denied.  A further application was brought on November 4, 1986 and it was also denied.  From mid-September until the end of October 1986 at least seven criminal lawyers were approached to represent the appellant at his scheduled trial of November 10, 1986.  Affidavits from these lawyers were filed indicating their inability to represent the appellant at this short notice.  On further application, O'Brien J. ordered that the trial not proceed until immediately after the disposition of another unrelated murder trial which was set to commence on November 17, 1986.  On December 4, 1986, the appellant brought another application to adjourn before Watt J.  This time, the request made by Mr. Bayne was granted and the date for the trial was set for April 21, 1987.  On April 21, 1987, the appellant appeared before Callon J. and indicated that he wished to re-elect to be tried by a judge sitting without a jury.  The question whether theCriminal Codegave an accused this right was scheduled to be argued before the Ontario Court of Appeal in May of 1987 (subsequently reported asR. v. Turpin(1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 289, appeal dismissed [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1296).  The matter was adjourned by Callon J. until the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court.  Callon J. felt it best to await the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Subsequently, at the June 1, 1987 Assignment Court the date of October 26, 1987 was set for the third trial.  At the onset of the third trial, on October 26, 1987, the appellant appeared before Smith J. and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge of murder but guilty on the lesser included offence of manslaughter.  The plea was not accepted by the Crown because the appellant would not agree to a joint submission for a sentence of 15 years.  The appellant consequently brought an application to stay on the basis that holding a third trial in the circumstances would constitute an abuse of process and, as well, on the basis that in view of the time elapsed since the beginning of these proceedings, there had been a violation of his right to be tried within a reasonable time guaranteed bys. 11(b)of theCharter.  The appellant was incarcerated for a period of thirteen and a half months including the period immediately after his arrest and after the first trial prior to the Court of Appeal's decision.  While on bail the appellant was subject to several restrictions including a provision that he not reside at his family home in Barrhaven.  He was also required to report to the Manotick detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police on a weekly basis.  As well, the length and number of proceedings over five years required that the appellant appear in court for two trials, one appeal and frequently for the purpose of obtaining trial dates and adjournments.  The appellant adduced evidence demonstrating that he suffered from stress, anxiety and stigmatization as a result of the delay.  The uncertainty which he faced was exacerbated by the length of the delay.  The delay resulted in the continued disruption of the appellant's family life and social life.  His education was disrupted and his health suffered.  The defence put forward by the appellant was self-defence and provocation.  Determination of these issues will depend onviva voceevidence.  The appellant alleges that his right to a fair trial has been prejudiced.

        "Facts": " 12For several years, the respondent Laurent Laroche and his wife operated Garage Côté Laroche Inc., whose principal business was repairing seriously damaged road vehicles.  A few years later, they added renting out industrial condominiums to that business, and the rentals are now an important source of income for the respondent Laroche.  The building of the condominiums was financed out of substantial investments, the source and legality of which the appellant has questioned.  13In Quebec, for road safety reasons, strict regulations have been put in place and must be complied with when a rebuilt vehicle is put on the road.  Under ss. 546.1et seq.of theHighway Safety Code, R.S.Q., c. C‑24.2, a person who wishes to license a rebuilt vehicle must obtain a certificate of technical compliance from the Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ).  The SAAQ or one of its agents will issue a certificate of compliance only when the rebuilt vehicle has been inspected and meets the manufacturer’s standards.  14In the course of an internal audit at Charest Automobile Ltée, which is an agent of the SAAQ, an SAAQ employee found serious irregularities in five rebuilt vehicle files submitted by Garage Côté Laroche Inc.  When the invoices and photos in the files were compared, it appeared that the same parts from a damaged vehicle had apparently been used to rebuild more than one vehicle.  The employee was convinced that the certificates of technical compliance for the vehicles in question had been obtained illegally, and referred the five fraudulent files to the Victoriaville police.  The files involved five Toyota Tacomas which, miraculously, shared some of the same parts.  15After an investigation, the five Toyota Tacomas were seized from their new owners pursuant to a warrant issued under s. 487Cr. C.  Investigations by experts from the Sûreté du Québec and the Groupement des assureurs automobiles showed that no major repairs had been done on the allegedly rebuilt vehicles and that the serial numbers on some of the parts had been altered.  On May 4, 2000, based on those analyses, the Crown filed charges of forgery, uttering forged documents and possession of stolen property against Laurent Laroche.  16Over the next few months, the police investigation took on dimensions that had been unsuspected at the outset.  It covered dozens of rebuilt vehicle files submitted between 1998 and 2000.  During the period of the investigation, the police obtained a number of search warrants under ss. 487 and 487.01Cr. C., and in addition, on February 18, 2000, they seized 154 rebuilt vehicle files involving Garage Côté Laroche Inc. and other companies related to Laurent Laroche from the SAAQ agent, which had issued the certificates of compliance for the five Toyota Tacomas.  An analysis of 142 of those 154 files showed serious irregularities in 98 cases.  They included the fact that identical invoices and photographs were found in more than one file, as well as invalid serial numbers.  A number of invoices were from businesses either non‑existent or no longer in operation on the billing date.  As well, parts that had apparently been purchased in the United States had been invoiced in French, with the G.S.T. and Q.S.T shown on the invoice!  17The scope of the respondents’ illegal activities prompted the police to extend their investigation to Laurent Laroche’s recent real estate acquisitions.  The title searches done regarding Laroche’s properties showed that he had apparently purchased immovables valued at about $1,800,000, and that there were no hypothecary charges against them.  On those findings being made, a police officer who was an investigator with the city of Victoriaville, Luc Morin, signed an affidavit in support of an application for a restraint order and special warrants of seizure, and the affidavit was submitted to Judge Pinard of the Court of Québec.  That application is what led to these proceedings.

        "Facts": " 19It was alleged that the appellant struck the deceased, Jo Anne Feddema, with his truck while she was riding her bicycle.  They lived in a small village in central British Columbia and were acquaintances.  The impact threw her, apparently injured, on the hood of his truck and she shouted, “You’re in trouble now.”  The appellant told the undercover officer that he panicked and killed her by striking her on the head with a blunt instrument.  He provided many details of the killing, including where the killing took place and how he disposed of her body and clothing, and how he had made it look as though she had been the victim of a sexual assault.  20The Crown conceded that without evidence of the appellant’s statements to the undercover officer, “the prosecution’s case collapsed”.  21The alleged confession came about because skillful police work persuaded the appellant over a period of months that undercover officers were all part of a very well‑run criminal enterprise which the appellant might care to join.  Early in the operation, the appellant advised one of the officers that the police did not like him.  When asked why, the appellant said, “They think I did a murder, they think I killed this broad.”  He continued to deny his involvement until towards the end of January 1997.  In the interim, he became ever more entangled in the supposed crime organization.  22The police officer’s evidence was that on January 29, 1997, in a room at the Landis Hotel in Vancouver, he told the appellant that through underworld contacts he could find someone suffering a terminal illness to make a false confession to the murder of Jo Anne Feddema provided the appellant supplied sufficient detail to make the confession believable.  (This was similar to the police work discussed recently inR. v. Mentuck, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, 2001 SCC 76, andR. v. O.N.E., [2001] 3 S.C.R. 478, 2001 SCC 77.)  At that point the appellant freely confessed to the murder, and on the following day took him to the various locations associated with the crime and described the events in detail.  The conversation of January 30th was also recorded but, unlike the tape made in the hotel room, it was of poor quality.  23The police had applied for and obtained an authorization under Part VI of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  By its terms, the authorization permitted the police surreptitiously to record the conversations between the appellant and the officer.  The conversations of January 29 and 30, 1997 were recorded pursuant to the authorization.  Transcripts were prepared.  The undercover officer reviewed the transcripts the day after each conversation took place, and made corrections based on listening to the tape supplemented with his recollection of those conversations.  A.The Evidentiary Rulings  24The trial judge having concluded that the authorization ought to have been refused for insufficiency of evidence, and the tape therefore having been obtained in violation ofs. 8of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the tapes and related transcripts were declared inadmissible.  25The appellant then moved to suppress the evidence of the undercover police officer because he said it was inextricably bound up with the transcripts of the tapes that had been ruled inadmissible.  The trial judge ruled that the officer could give evidence “as to his present recollection of what occurred in that hotel room on January 29th” and, for that purpose, he could make use of the corrected transcripts (euphemistically described as his “notes”) to refresh his memory.  He had not in fact made notes of the conversation, believing that the tape itself, having been authorized, would be admissible.  26This appeal, and the disputed ruling, relate only to the January 29th conversation at the Landis Hotel.  B.The Officer’s Evidence on the Voir Dire  27In the witness box, the officer’s evidence followed closely, often word for word, the corrected transcript of the January 29th conversation.  When challenged by the defence, he explained in avoir direthat, within a day of the original conversation, he had received a typed transcript of the tapes.  He took the tape and the transcribed copy of the tape “and I proofread the transcribed copy with the tape and I made changes on it.  Also adding comments of my own.  I then sent that back to be retyped with my corrections and my comments and I received back the corrected copy”.  The original document showing his handwritten changes and corrections was not entered in evidence.  The retyped “corrected” version is 49 pages in length, double-spaced.  The cross-examination continued:  Q.   -- what you did was you listened to the voices on the tape?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And you identified certain of the voices, for example, as your own, as those of Peter William Fliss and as that of [a third person]?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And there would be some, presumably, areas where you felt you could make out words and you wrote those in?  A.   Yes.  Q.   And that was from the tape?  A.   The tape as well as my memory of the conversation itself.   28Later, when it was suggested to him by defence counsel that the officer’s present recollection of the January 29th conversation was “inextricably bound” up with his subsequent review of the tape and the transcript, he responded:  A.   No, I have a definite independent recollection of the meeting between myself and Mr. Fliss on January 29th,’97.  Q.   Do you have any notes of that independent recollection?  A.   Well, no.  . . .  Q.   . . . the only note you have of the content of the conversation is what you have referred to as your notes which you have been reading from and which are a transcript from the taped cassette of a wiretap of the conversation, correct?  A.   Yes.  29The trial judge found that the officer created a corrected transcript that could properly be described as his “notes”.  He permitted the officer to give in testimony what was “basically a recitation” of the corrected transcript.  C.The Verdict  30The jury, apparently accepting some evidence that death was caused while the appellant was committing or attempting to commit an aggravated sexual assault, returned with a verdict of first degree murder.  31On appeal, because of the conflicting evidence of the Crown’s experts with respect to the alleged sexual assault, a verdict of second degree murder was substituted.  The appeal was otherwise dismissed, Southin J.A. dissenting.  In her view, theviva voceevidence of the officer was inadmissible and the conviction ought to have been quashed.  The appellant now appeals as of right to this Court on the question of law raised by Southin J.A.’s dissent, namely whether the trial judge erred in admitting theviva voceevidence of the police officer of his conversation with the appellant on January 29, 1997, having previously ruled that evidence of the transcript of that same conversation was inadmissible.

        "Facts": " The appellants were among some 80 individuals simultaneously arrested on January 22, 1985 after the culmination of a police investigation into the manufacture and distribution of illicit drugs by members of two motorcycle clubs.  The Crown initially laid a single information against 61 individuals charging them with conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD.  A preliminary hearing was scheduled for December 2, 1985.  However, in November 1985 the Honourable John Crosbie, Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, preferred two indictments, replacing the original information and cancelling the preliminary hearing.  One indictment was presented in the Supreme Court of Ontario and named 12 accused.  The other indictment was presented in the District Court of Ontario and named 27 accused including the appellants.  The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were jointly charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine between October 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  The appellant Jeffreys was charged with one count of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine between June 1, 1983 and January 23, 1985.  The trial in the Supreme Court of Ontario proceeded first.  It began on June 2, 1986 before Bowlby J.  Verdicts were rendered on February 27, 1987.  The appellants and seven other accused were tried in the District Court of Ontario before Judge O'Connell and a jury.  That trial began on May 11, 1987.  Pre-trial motions were heard throughout May, June and September.  Verdicts were rendered on June 11, 1988.  The appellants Farinacci and Lépine were convicted of conspiracy to traffic in methamphetamine.  The appellant Jeffreys was convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine.  The evidence against the appellants consisted of testimony from informant witnesses, results of physical surveillance and recordings of telephone conversations.  One of the pre-trial motions entertained by the trial judge was a \"Wilson\" motion (named after the decision of this Court inWilson v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594) in which the appellants challenged the validity of seven wiretap authorizations which permitted the police to intercept their telephone conversations.  The impugned authorizations were granted by Judge Scott of the District Court of Ontario.  Two other authorizations were granted by Trainor and Ewaschuk JJ., both of the Supreme Court of Ontario.  Prior to theWilsonhearing, the trial judge ordered the packets containing the material filed in support of all the authorizations to be opened.  He then stated his intention to remove the affidavits from the sealed packet and edit them.  He explained that after editing the affidavits himself he would give a copy of the edited affidavits to the Crown to determine if further editing needed to be done.  He would then give copies to counsel for the various accused and hear any \"suggestions\" they had about the affidavits.  After the adjournment, the trial judge indicated that he had read each affidavit in light of the decision inParmar.  He claimed to have edited the affidavits \"only insofar as they contain information from informants and others which is to be protected, and insofar as they contain summary or opinion\".  He then proceeded to review the edited affidavits with the Crown, who suggested a few additional deletions.  In a few instances the Crown indicated that material edited by the trial judge could be disclosed.  These suggestions were adopted by the trial judge.  The accused and their counsel were present throughout this exercise.  The trial judge then proposed to distribute the edited affidavits to counsel.  However, before this took place, counsel for the appellant Farinacci made a submission requesting \"all information contained in these affidavits, other than the specific name and identifying address, or the like of anybody who purports to be in the position of an informant or informer, as the case may be\".  The Crown argued that this submission was premature.  The trial judge agreed.  At that point counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested clarification of the procedure which the trial judge intended to follow.   He specifically asked whether the appellants would \"have some input to request further information from the affidavits\".  The trial judge made it clear that the next step in the process was that the defence would receive copies of the edited affidavits and then the actualWilsonhearing would proceed.  Once the edited affidavits were distributed to counsel, but before reviewing them, counsel for the appellant Farinacci, relying heavily on the decision inParmar, re-asserted the right of the defence to the deleted information.  Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys requested an indication of the basis upon which the deletions were made.  The trial judge then suggested that every deletion met all four criteria set out inParmar.  However, he also stated that in one or two cases he had deleted some \"commentary\".  After counsel were given an opportunity to review the edited affidavits, counsel for the appellant Farinacci again attempted to make submissions regarding the deletions that had been made.  Counsel pointed out that the deletions made by the trial judge went beyond those which were made from the same affidavits by Bowlby J.  The trial judge characterized the deletions which had been made by Bowlby J. as \"irrelevant\" to what he was doing.  Counsel for the appellant Farinacci then asked about a specific deletion from one of the affidavits, asking if it was appropriate to inquire into whether his client's name appeared in the deleted materials and in what context.  The trial judge indicated that it was not appropriate for him to inquire, stating that the deletion was made \"in the interests of the persons involved\" and that all the deletions he made \"were strictly related to informants, and one or two other minor deletions which related to commentary...\".  Counsel for the appellant Jeffreys stated that the defence were, at leastprima facie, entitled to all information reflecting on the reasonable and probable grounds upon which the authorizations were granted.  The trial judge flatly rejected this submission.  The Crown submitted that \"[t]he accused are entitled to know if they are named in the deleted portions.\"  The trial judge then proceeded to list those accused named in the deleted portions of the nine affidavits.  Defence counsel was also advised that no confidential sources had died, were potential Crown witnesses or were police officers.  At theWilsonhearing, the appellants cross-examined the three police officers who swore affidavits in support of the nine authorizations.  The trial judge ruled that defence counsel could not cross-examine the \"sub-affiants\" who supplied information to the affiants.  However, he granted the appellants leave to call two additional police officers as witnesses.  On June 24, 1987 the trial judge dismissed the application to set aside the seven District Court authorizations.  Shortly after this hearing, the appellants brought an application before Watt J. to set aside the two Supreme Court authorizations.  Watt J. edited the affidavits filed in support of these authorizations less extensively than O'Connell Dist. Ct. J. had edited the same affidavits before distributing them to defence counsel.  Ultimately, Watt J. dismissed the application to set aside these two authorizations.  The appellants also brought a motion to quash O'Connell Dist. Ct. J.'s rulings and sought prohibition in the Supreme Court of Ontario in order to prevent him from admitting, in his capacity as trial judge, primary evidence obtained from the seven impugned District Court authorizations.  This motion was heard and dismissed by Watt J. on September 10, 1987:R. v. Durette(1987), 61 O.R. (2d) 590, 37 C.C.C. (3d) 126.  No appeal was taken from this decision.  The appellants appealed their convictions to the Court of Appealinter aliain respect of the validity of the wiretap authorizations and the admissibility and use of the recordings intercepted pursuant thereto.  On May 15, 1992, the Court of Appeal, Doherty J.A. dissenting, dismissed the appeal:R. v. Durette (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 557, 54 O.A.C. 81, 72 C.C.C. (3d) 421.  The appellants appeal to this Court as of right pursuant tos. 691(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46. "

        "Facts": " On December 22, 1989 Durham Regional Police Forces (\"DRPF\") investigated the death of Frank Dowson.  Police described the incident as accidental, but suspicious.  However, after inspecting the scene and interviewing the appellant and another person who resided in the same home as the deceased, the investigation was discontinued and no charges were laid.  On February 6, 1990, at approximately 5:20 p.m., Constable Trimm of the DRPF noted that the appellant had startled two passers-by while he was panhandling on a street in Oshawa.  Trimm stopped his vehicle and questioned the appellant who identified himself as Doug Whittle.  The officer then conducted a computer check through the Canadian Police Information Centre and discovered three outstanding committal warrants against the appellant which related to unpaid fines for provincial offence convictions.  Trimm suspected from the appellant's conduct that he was schizophrenic and the appellant confirmed this when questioned about it.  Trimm cautioned the appellant as to his rights and arrested him on the basis of the outstanding warrants.  The appellant did not exercise his right to consult counsel.  The appellant was then taken by Trimm to a DRPF station where he was placed in a cell.  Constable Trimm told the cell officer that the appellant was mentally unstable and noted \"very mentally unstable\" on the arrest report.  Since the outstanding warrants emanated from the Metro Toronto jurisdiction, the appellant was transported to Metro Police Station, 42 Division at around 6 p.m.  Before being placed in a cell at that location, the appellant again declined to make any phone calls.  Over the course of the next two hours, the appellant made several statements to the station operator and to the staff sergeant at 42 Division.  The first statements indicated that the appellant had been involved in some heavy matters about which he wished to clear the slate.  In later conversations with these officers, the statements became more specific, with the appellant indicating that he had been involved in a number of robberies in Windsor.  At the point when the statements became more specific, two Metro police detectives were asked by the station operator to speak with the appellant.  Detective Constable Orban spoke with the appellant in his cell.  During the course of this conversation, the appellant indicated that he had killed Frank Dowson just before Christmas in 1989 by hitting him on the back of the head with an axe.  In addition, the appellant stated that he had been involved in three robberies in Windsor approximately five years earlier.  Orban testified that he had dealt with the appellant on prior occasions when the appellant had been ejected from donut shops and found sleeping in abandoned cars.  Orban characterized the appellant as a \"loon\", a person whose actions were abnormal, based on the appearance, dress, conduct and manner of speaking of the appellant on prior occasions.  Relying on this impression of the appellant, Orban asked his partner that evening, Detective Constable Gillespie, to speak with the appellant, referring to him as \"the loon\" in the cells.  On speaking with Gillespie, the appellant repeated the same facts which he had relayed to Orban.  Orban and Gillespie then left the cells in order to attempt to verify the occurrences.  At approximately 8:20 p.m. Orban spoke with someone from the DRPF who indicated that a Frank Dowson had died under suspicious circumstances in Whitby just prior to Christmas.  With this confirmation in hand, Orban and Gillespie proceeded to the cells, cautioned the appellant as to his right to counsel and to remain silent, and arrested him for the murder of Frank Dowson.  The appellant indicated that he understood his rights, but that he did not wish to contact a lawyer.  After Gillespie confirmed the Windsor occurrences, at about 9:10 p.m., he arrested the appellant in relation to those robberies.  Again, the appellant was cautioned as to his rights, but he indicated that he did not wish to speak with anyone other than the officers.  Gillespie then questioned the appellant in relation to the axe which he had mentioned in his earlier statement.  The appellant told the officers that he had sawed the axe in half and thrown it in a field near Brock St. and Highway 401.  The appellant then accompanied Orban and Gillespie to the location which he described where they met with two other officers from DRPF.  During the 15-minute car trip to that location, the appellant \"talked continuously\" about the Windsor offences and the occurrence in Whitby.  Although the search was unsuccessful at that point, the axe handle was located during a subsequent search of that area.  On the return trip from the area, the appellant continued to disclose details relating to the murder, including the fact that he had disposed of his shoes after the incident and took precautions to avoid leaving fingerprints at the scene.  Interspersed with this running discussion by the appellant were a series of two or three incidents in which the appellant stopped talking and made reference to someone being in his brain or having fog in his head.  After this, he would continue talking about the incidents in question, as if these digressions had never occurred.  Detective Constable Orban testified that it was more what the appellant said than how he said it which indicated to him that certain of the appellant's statements were divorced from reality.  During the return trip from the 401 location, Gillespie suggested that the appellant make a video statement and the appellant indicated that he liked that idea.  They proceeded to 4 District Headquarters where videotape facilities were available and Gillespie again advised the appellant of his rights under theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  Once again, the appellant indicated that he did not wish to speak with a lawyer.  Taping of the first video commenced at 11:40 p.m. on February 6, 1990.  At the outset, the appellant confirmed that he had made statements relating to the commission of serious criminal offences earlier in the evening.  Gillespie then questioned the appellant as to whether he wished to consult counsel and, after some discussion, the appellant indicated that he did wish to consult counsel.  Following on this request, Gillespie contacted a defence attorney, Robert Nuttall, on behalf of the appellant.  Gillespie spoke first with Nuttall and told him that the appellant had confessed to several serious crimes.  Nuttall agreed to speak with the appellant and testified that he had advised the appellant to \"keep his mouth shut\".  He also testified that the appellant had told him that he had voices in his head, that he had to talk, that he had a pain in his head and that he could see dead babies' faces in cement.  The appellant told Nuttall that he needed to talk to the police in order to stop the voices.  After speaking with the appellant, Nuttall was convinced that the appellant would speak with authorities against his advice.  When the appellant turned the phone over to Gillespie, Nuttall indicated that he agreed with Gillespie's characterization of the appellant as a \"loon\" or a \"nutbar\" and that he was sure that the appellant would speak with the authorities, in spite of Nuttall's advice to the contrary.  Nuttall also told Gillespie that any other officers who wished to speak with the appellant should contact Nuttall before doing so.  As predicted by Nuttall, the appellant indicated that he still wished to continue with the video statement.  In the result, a second video statement was initiated at 12:21 a.m. on February 7, 1990.  This statement lasted approximately one hour.  At the outset, the appellant stated that he had not committed the offences described in the committal warrants and alleged \"somebody has used my name\".  He described his reason for coming to the police as the result of \"crackin' in [his] mind\" and his resulting inability to live in society any longer.  When reminded of the exercise of his right to counsel, the appellant acknowledged that he was informed that he had the right not to speak with the police, but that he wanted to talk to them anyway.  Further, he indicated that he understood that it would be up to a judge whether or not his statements would be used in making a decision about him.  After some prompting by Gillespie, the appellant repeated the details relating to the death of Frank Dowson which he had relayed earlier.  Throughout the video statement the appellant made comments such as \"I'm just ah, feel like I got snow in my head\", \"I feel like I got [other people's] brains on me . . . So they're always tryin' a' think out a' me ... And every time I say somethin', unless I been asked a question, I can't think above them . . . we're both bein' punished\", and \"I managed to, ah, come up with this idea to walk backwards to New Brunswick . . . That would exercise me back to normal\".  When asked whether he had been forced to say anything, the appellant indicated that he was uncertain whether he had been manipulated into it in that \"somebody maybe plotted murder in this life and they picked me to do it for them, right?\".  The appellant also stated that he had always wanted to die, but that he had never been able to and that he intended to stay on his tippy-toes regardless of whether anyone liked it.  After the video statement was taken the appellant volunteered to take Detective Constables Orban and Gillespie to the place where he claimed to have disposed of the wallet of Frank Dowson.  Although the wallet was not located on the trip to the ravine that night, it was located by Orban and Gillespie in that area some time over the next two days.  When found the wallet contained $800 in cash and at least one credit card bearing the name Frank Dowson.  Orban and Gillespie transported the appellant back to 42 Division, Metro Toronto Police Force.  At about 4:10 p.m., Detective Constables Carroll and Chambers of the DRPF spoke with the appellant in an interview room at 42 Division.  The appellant was arrested for the first degree murder of Frank Dowson and cautioned as to hisCharterrights, which the appellant indicated that he understood.  The appellant did not exercise his right to counsel.  Although there had been some indication by members of the Metro Toronto Police Force that Chambers and Carroll should contact the appellant's lawyer, they proceeded to transport the appellant back to 17 Division DRPF in Oshawa without doing so.  During the drive back to 17 Division, the appellant responded to questioning by Chambers, providing the details of the death of Frank Dowson, including what Dowson was wearing, the amount of cash in his wallet and the fact that the appellant had hit him in the head with the blunt side of an axe.  The appellant also indicated that after he hit Dowson, he went to a friend's house to purchase drugs.  The appellant's lawyer, Robert Nuttall, testified that he saw the appellant on or about February 8 and 16, 1990.  At this point, the behaviour of the appellant was judged by Nuttall to be quite bizarre.  As a result, Nuttall consented to the appellant being remanded to the Metropolitan Toronto Forensic Service (\"METFORS\") facility for psychiatric examination in order to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.  The next contact which Chambers and Carroll had with the appellant was on March 16, 1990 when the appellant was being returned from a 30-day psychiatric assessment.  Chambers and Carroll met the appellant on the back stairs of the court house and followed him to the cell block there.  The appellant indicated that he wanted to speak to them even though his lawyer had advised him not to.  The appellant then stated that there had been no blood around Dowson's mouth after he had hit him, but that when he returned to the scene, Dowson was laying on the floor with blood around his mouth.  He also indicated the name and address of the person from whom he claimed to have purchased drugs after the incident in question.  Prior to trial, the appellant underwent psychiatric examination the results of which supported his fitness to stand trial.  Apparently for this reason no issue was raised by either the prosecution, the defence or the court as to the appellant's fitness to stand trial.  At the commencement of the trial, Crown counsel proposed to introduce into evidence all of the statements made by the appellant to various police officers.  In order to deal with the admissibility of this evidence avoir direwas held, during which a number of expert witnesses were called.  Perhaps the most central testimony came from Dr. Malcolm, who testified for the defence, and Dr. McDonald, who testified for the Crown.  Dr. McDonald is a forensic psychiatrist with METFORS who examined the appellant during his 30-day psychiatric assessment in February and March 1990.  Dr. Malcolm is also a forensic psychiatrist.  Both gave the opinion that the appellant suffers from schizophrenia and that a common symptom of this illness is auditory hallucination.  However, Dr. Malcolm testified that the appellant's condition would have been florid at the time of the video statement and that although the appellant may have been rationally aware of the consequences of giving the statement, he was driven to make the statements by the voices in his head.  In contrast, Dr. McDonald testified that it was possible that the appellant had been experiencing auditory hallucinations at the time of the video statement, but that there was no specific evidence of that in the tape itself.  Ruling on thevoir dire, the trial judge concluded that the exculpatory statement made by the appellant on December 22, 1989 was admissible, but that the inculpatory statements made on February 6, 7 and March 16, 1990 were inadmissible.  Crown counsel then advised that no further evidence would be called on behalf of the Crown.  The trial judge then instructed the jury to deliver a verdict of acquittal and a \"not guilty\" verdict was returned.  The respondent Crown successfully appealed the acquittal of the appellant.  The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial which would include all of the statements made by the appellant.

C-46 , which permits a provincial court judge, on ex parte application, to authorize the collection of DNA samples from three classes of previously convicted and sentenced offenders: (a) persons already declared to be “dangerous offenders”; (b) persons convicted of “more than one murder committed at different times”; and (c) persons convicted of “more than one sexual offence” and who, on the date of the application, are still serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for one or more of those offences.  In contrast to ss. 487.051 and 487.052 which target convicted offenders whose cases are still before the court for sentencing, applications under this provision will be referred to as retrospective applications.",
            "4                                   There is no question that DNA evidence has revolutionized the way many crimes are investigated and prosecuted.  The use of this new technology has not only led to the successful identification and prosecution of many dangerous criminals, it has served to exonerate many persons who were wrongfully suspected or convicted.  The importance of this forensic development to the administration of justice can hardly be overstated.  At the same time, the profound implications of government seizure and use of DNA samples on the privacy and security of the person cannot be ignored.  A proper balance between these competing interests must be achieved within our constitutional framework.",
            "7                                   Before turning to the facts and issues under appeal, I will review the DNA data bank provisions contained in the DNA Identification Act , S.C. 1998, c. 37 , and the Criminal Code .  A clear understanding of the legislative scheme and its purpose is necessary to deal with the constitutional arguments advanced by the parties.",
            "8                                   The DNA Identification Act  governs the creation, operation and maintenance of a national DNA data bank.  The Act must be read in conjunction with the Criminal Code  provisions dealing with the collection and use of DNA samples.  This Court in R. v. S.A.B., [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678, 2003 SCC 60, described the DNA provisions as falling into two sets.  The first, the constitutionality of which was upheld in S.A.B., regulates the search and seizure of DNA material from a suspect for investigative purposes in respect of a designated offence.  The second set of provisions governs the collection of DNA evidence from convicted persons for the purpose of inclusion in a national DNA data bank.  Section 487.055, the impugned provision on this appeal, falls in this latter set.",
            "9                                   There are three categories of convicted offenders in respect of which a judicial authorization to seize DNA samples may be obtained for data bank purposes.  First, s. 487.051 applies in respect of offenders convicted of a designated offence after the proclamation of the DNA Identification Act .  Second, s. 487.052 deals with convicted offenders who have committed a designated offence prior to the proclamation of the DNA Identification Act  but are still before the court.  (Designated offences are defined under s. 487.04  of the Criminal Code  and, in general, may be described as the more serious offences under the Criminal Code  in respect of which it may reasonably be expected that DNA may be left behind by the offender.) Third, s. 487.055 applies to three classes of offenders who have been convicted and sentenced prior to the proclamation of the DNA Identification Act :  (a) persons already declared to be “dangerous offenders”; (b) persons convicted of “more than one murder committed at different times”; and (c) persons convicted of “more than one sexual offence” and who, on the date of the application, are still serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for one or more of those offences.  (The list of targeted offenders has since been expanded by deleting the requirement that there be “more than one murder committed at different times” and by including dangerous sexual offenders and persons convicted of manslaughter who, on the date of the application, are still serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for that offence (S.C. 2005, c. 25, s. 5).)  Only s. 487.055, the retrospective provision, is in issue on this appeal.  However, the alleged s. 8 constitutional deficiency — the absence of reasonable and probable grounds linking the convicted offender to a particular investigation — is equally present in all three provisions."

Bryant states:  ...the removal of this alternative plea on the basis that the testimony of the complainant and the accused are diametrically opposed, and that there is a lack of common ground for the defence is based, in part, on the premise that the complainant's version is complete -- a questionable assumption in some cases.  Moreover, a requirement for corroboration may wrongly encourage an accused to dovetail partially his testimony with that of the complainant in order to supply the necessary common ground for the defence.

C-46 , and that an awareness of that lack of disclosure is an element of its mens rea. I depart from Cory J. on two points, however. First, with respect to the timing of disclosure, certainty requires that where the gravamen of the offence is the taking of a secret commission disclosure to the principal must be made by the time the commission is accepted. Second, with respect to the degree of disclosure required, the requirements of s. 426(1)(a)(ii) will, in my view, be satisfied if the agent discloses to the principal that he will receive a commission with respect to the transaction in question. Thus, an agent who advises his principal in advance that he will be receiving a commission with respect to a particular transaction will be innocent of any offence under s. 426(1)(a)(ii)."

        "Facts": " There is no doubt that the facts in this case arouse more sympathy for the appellants than did those inKelly.  Nevertheless, the question as to whether the disclosure was adequate in all the circumstances must still be determined.  I cannot accept the contention that the findings made at the trial are adequate to resolve the issue.  The Court of Appeal was correct in its conclusion that the trial judge's finding that the Crown had failed to prove the requisite intent was based on a misapprehension as to the intent required. For the reasons set out inKelly, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish that there was a corrupt bargain.  Nor was the trial judge correct as to the standard of disclosure that was required.  The argument that there was a finding made at trial that there was no secrecy on the part of the appellants cannot be accepted.  That finding was made only in relation to the appellants' books which disclosed all the transactions.  The testimony given by clients of the appellants was overwhelmingly to the effect that no disclosure was made to them that commissions would be received by the appellants from the promoters of the developments for the sale of the units.  It will be for the judge presiding at the new trial to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, the disclosure made by the appellants to their clients was adequate and timely.  The Court of Appeal correctly determined that there must be a new trial with regard to that issue.

            "[13] The central issue on this appeal is whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand breath samples from Mr. Shepherd.  Section 254(3)  of the Criminal Code , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 , requires that an officer have reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence under s. 253 of the Code (impaired driving or over 80) before making a breathalyzer demand.  As this Court explained in R. v. Bernshaw, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, at para. 51:  “The requirement in s. 254(3) that reasonable and probable grounds exist is not only a statutory but a constitutional requirement as a precondition to a lawful search and seizure under s. 8  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .”",
            "[16] As noted above, s. 254(3)  of the Criminal Code  requires that the officer have reasonable grounds to believe that within the preceding three hours, the accused has committed, or is committing, an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code .  The onus is on the Crown to prove that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand because the Crown seeks to rely on breath samples obtained as a result of a warrantless search.  It would also be impractical to place the burden on the accused because evidence of the presence or absence of reasonable and probable grounds is within the “peculiar knowledge” of the Crown (R. v. Bartle, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, at p. 210).",
            "[17] As this Court noted in Bernshaw, there is both a subjective and an objective component to establishing reasonable and probable grounds; that is, the officer must have an honest belief that the suspect committed an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code , and there must be reasonable grounds for this belief (Bernshaw, at para. 48).  Here, it is not disputed that the officer had a subjective belief that Mr. Shepherd was intoxicated.  The courts below disagreed, however, on whether the officer’s subjective belief was reasonable in the circumstances.",
            "[23] With respect, it is our view that the trial judge erred in finding that the officer’s subjective belief of impairment was not objectively supported on the facts.  The officer’s belief was based not only on the accused’s erratic driving pattern but also on the various indicia of impairment which he observed after he arrested Mr. Shepherd.  The trial judge placed substantial weight on Mr. Shepherd’s explanation that he thought the police vehicle was an ambulance.  Leaving aside the fact that this confusion itself can be a sign of impairment, it is important to note that the officer need not have anything more than reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the driver committed the offence of impaired driving or driving “over 80” before making the demand. He need not demonstrate a prima facie case for conviction before pursuing his investigation.  In our view, there was ample evidence to support the officer’s subjective belief that Mr. Shepherd had committed an offence under s. 253  of the Criminal Code .  We therefore conclude that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand, and that Mr. Shepherd’s Charter  claim must fail.",

        "Facts": " [5]In the early morning of January 11, 2003, Sgt. Sellers of the Saskatoon City Police Service saw Mr. Shepherd’s vehicle fail to stop at a stop sign and then begin to travel at 20 to 25 kilometres per hour over the posted speed limit.  Sgt. Sellers activated his police cruiser’s siren and lights in an effort to get the vehicle to pull over.  The vehicle slowed down but did not stop.  It then accelerated and changed lanes multiple times over approximately a three-kilometre distance before finally pulling over.  [6]Sgt. Sellers approached the vehicle and informed Mr. Shepherd that he was under arrest for failing to stop for the police.  Mr. Shepherd explained that he had not stopped because he thought the police car was an ambulance.  The officer noted that Mr. Shepherd looked lethargic and fatigued and had red eyes.  He could smell alcohol on his breath.  He also noted that his movements and speech were slow and deliberate.  On the basis of these observations, Sgt. Sellers formed the opinion that Mr. Shepherd was “intoxicated”.  The officer read Mr. Shepherd hisCharterrights and made a breathalyzer demand.  [7]Mr. Shepherd was taken to the police station by Cst. Horsley, another officer who arrived at the scene shortly after Mr. Shepherd’s arrest.  On the way there, Mr. Shepherd repeated his explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  Mr. Shepherd provided two breath samples at the police station.  At trial, he moved to have the samples excluded on the basis that they were obtained in violation ofss. 8and9of theCharter.  [8]The trial judge accepted Sgt. Sellers’ evidence that he subjectively believed that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol, but concluded that this belief was not objectively reasonable.  In reaching his decision, the trial judge relied heavily on the accused’s explanation to Cst. Horsley that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  The trial judge noted that this was “just as valid an explanation” for Mr. Shepherd’s erratic driving as the suggestion that he was impaired by alcohol (Appellant’s Record, Part II, at p. 7).  The accused’s explanation also left the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused had the intention to evade police when he failed to stop.  He acquitted Mr. Shepherd of all charges.  [9]The Crown appealed the acquittals on the impaired driving and driving “over 80” charges to the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench. Foley J., the summary conviction appeal judge, upheld the trial judge’s decision (2006 SKQB 91, 30 M.V.R. (5th) 307).  He noted that although the trial judge was wrong to rely on Mr. Shepherd’s explanation to Cst. Horsley since it was given subsequent to Sgt. Sellers’ demand, an “identical explanation” was provided to Sgt. Sellers before the demand was made (para. 12).  Accordingly, Foley J. was of the view that the error did not result in a miscarriage of justice.  He also concluded that there was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s “factual finding” that the officer did not have objective grounds to make the demand (para. 16).  He dismissed the appeal.  [10]A majority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and ordered a new trial (2007 SKCA 29, 45 C.R. (6th) 213).  Sherstobitoff J.A. concluded that on the facts as found by the trial judge, the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused’s ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.  He stated that the trial judge failed to give sufficient consideration to the officer’s opinion that Mr. Shepherd was intoxicated, while at the same time affording undue weight to the accused’s evidence that he thought the police car was an ambulance.  Lane J.A. was in substantial agreement with Sherstobitoff J.A., adding that, in his view, the trial judge’s acceptance of the accused’s explanation for his erratic driving was the result of a misreading of Mr. Shepherd’s obligations under theHighway Traffic Act, S.S. 1986, c. H-3.1.  Even if the police car had in fact been an ambulance as believed by Mr. Shepherd, his conduct would not have complied with the requirements of s. 67(8) of the Act concerning emergency vehicles.  [11]Smith J.A., in dissent, would have dismissed the appeal.  She was of the view that the trial judge made his ruling upon a review of the evidence as a whole, including the fact that Mr. Shepherd appeared to be in complete control of the vehicle while he was driving and the physical indicia of impairment were minimal and inconclusive.  No roadside sobriety test was administered, and some of the officer’s evidence regarding signs of impairment was successfully challenged on cross-examination.  [12]Having found aCharterviolation, Smith J.A. then considered whether the samples should be excluded unders. 24(2)of theCharter.  Smith J.A.’s analysis centered on whether breath samples obtained in breach of theCharterare subject to automatic exclusion as conscriptive evidence, or whether all three categories of factors inR. v. Collins, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, should be considered in deciding whether to exclude the evidence.  She concluded thatR. v. Stillman, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607, did not create an exception for breath samples; as non-discoverable, conscriptive evidence, they were automatically excluded under the trial fairness branch ofCollins.  After reviewing cases subsequent toStillmanwhich suggest thatStillmannever intended to create an automatic exclusionary rule for conscriptive evidence, Smith J.A. concluded thatStillmanwas still the leading authority on this point, and thus (barring rare exceptions) such evidence should be excluded without considering the second and third branches of theCollinstest.

        "Facts": " The accused, Imre Finta, was born in Kolozsvar, Hungary (now a part of Romania) in 1912.  During the 1930s, he lived and studied law in Szeged, Hungary.  In 1935, Mr. Finta enrolled in the Royal Hungarian Military Academy and in January 1939 he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Hungarian Gendarmerie.  The Gendarmerie is most accurately described as an armed paramilitary police force which served the Hungarian government by wielding political muscle in the country's more rural areas.  By 1942, Mr. Finta had achieved the rank of captain in this notorious organization.  In March 1944, Mr. Finta was posted to Szeged as commander of the investigative subdivision of the Gendarmerie.  That same month Hungary had been occupied by the forces of the Third Reich.  Despite the fact that Hungary had joined the Axis powers in 1940, Germany proceeded to install an even more pro-German puppet government in the Hungarian capital of Budapest.  Thus, throughout the relevant period, Hungary was ade factooccupied state.  The Hungarian police and the Gendarmerie came under the direct command of the German SS, and these two organizations were instrumental in administering the anti-Jewish laws adopted by the Nazi government of Germany and the Hungarian government under its control.  The charges against Mr. Finta stem from his time in Szeged.  Mr. Finta is alleged to have been in charge of the \"de-jewification\" of Szeged during the spring of 1944.  This activity was authorized by the so-called \"Baky Order\", the Hungarian Ministry of the Interior Order passed on April 7, 1944.  In its essentials, the \"Baky Order\" called for the isolation, complete expropriation, ghettoization, concentration, entrainment, and eventual deportation (primarily to Auschwitz and Birkenau) of all Hungarian Jews.  Once there, these Jews faced either immediate extermination or forced labour followed by eventual extermination.  The events at Szeged were duplicated in villages and towns across Hungary throughout that unfortunate spring.  There can be no doubt that this process, which my colleague, Justice Cory, has described in all its horrific detail, was an integral part of what the Nazis themselves dubbed the \"final solution\" to the \"Jewish problem\", namely the systematic slaughter of every last European Jew.  In 1947-48, Mr. Finta was tried and convicted,in absentia, by a Szeged court for \"crimes against the people\" relating to his role as a Gendarmerie captain during the spring of 1944 purge of Szeged's Jewish population.  In 1951, Finta immigrated to Canada.  In 1956 he became a Canadian citizen, and has lived in this country ever since.  Mr. Finta was charged with unlawful confinement, robbery, kidnapping and manslaughter of 8,617 Jews between May 16 and June 30, 1944 at or about Szeged, Hungary, thereby committing an offence under the definitions of these crimes in theCriminal Codeexisting at the time the offences were committed.  The indictment added that such offences constituted crimes against humanity and war crimes under what is nows. 7(3.71)of theCriminal Code.  The latter reference was added because prosecution for crimes committed abroad cannot ordinarily take place in Canada since criminal offences are generally confined to conduct that takes place in Canada (s. 6 of theCode), and the conduct alleged here took place in Hungary.  Section 7(3.71), however, permits prosecution for conduct outside Canada if such conduct constitutes a crime against humanity or a war crime and would have been a crime in Canada at the time it took place had it been committed here.  As Cory J. states, the principal issue in this case concerns a proper understanding of this and related provisions permitting persons to be prosecuted in Canada for crimes against Canadian law if these crimes also constitute crimes against humanity or war crimes under international law.  My colleague has set forth the judicial history of the case and I need not repeat it except as may be necessary in setting forth my views.  For the moment, it suffices to set forth the basic procedural steps in the proceedings.  Following a pre-trial motion before the late Callaghan A.C.J. of the Ontario Court, General Division, to consider a number of constitutional issues regarding the validity of the legislation under theCharter, a trial was held before Campbell J. sitting with a jury.  The accused was acquitted and the acquittal was affirmed by a majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal, Dubin C.J. and the late Tarnopolsky J.A. dissenting.  From that decision, the Crown appealed to this Court, raising seven grounds of appeal.

        ],
        "Facts": " The Court of Appeal found there was no abuse of process orCharterviolation in theCrown's staying of proceedings before the first judge after the adverse ruling, and then recommencing them before a new judge.  It stated thatCrowncounsel was not simply circumventing an unfavourable ruling, but was protecting an important public interest. Observing that the use of a stay must remain subject to judicial review, it concluded that \"having regard to the public interests with which theCrownwas concerned, there was compelling reason to stay the proceedings\".  In essence, the Court of Appeal is saying that the use of a stay to circumvent an adverse ruling is legitimate because theCrownhad a good reason founded in public interest for following the course it did.  I question whether such reasoning is sufficient to avoid the inference of abuse of process.   As this Court stated inKeyowski,supra, theCrown's good faith and motive are only two of the factors to be considered in determining whether an abuse of process is made out.    The same has repeatedly been held with respect toCharterbreaches; under theCharterlack of good faith and motive are irrelevant on the question of whether the accused's rights have been breached, although they may be considered unders. 24(2)in determining the use to which evidence obtained as a result of a breach may be put.   It would appear at least necessary to take the further step of examining the magnitude of the affront to justice and fairness against the public interest in prosecution.  The reasoning of the Court of Appeal, moreover, fails to fully address the real concerns raised by theCrown's conduct -- concerns relating to judge-shopping, the impartiality of the administration of justice and the integrity and dignity of the judicial process.  I have the same concerns with regard to the reasons of my colleague, Cory J.   He, too, emphasizes that theCrownacted in good faith and that its actions were not abusive, in the sense that they were aimed at protecting the identity of a police informer.  This, while relevant, is insufficient in itself to justify an abuse of process.  Cory J. makes two further points.  TheCrown, he says, had no alternative but to stay the trial in order to fulfil its duty.  I cannot agree.  TheCrown, faced with the evidentiary ruling which might have led to disclosure of the informer's identity, could have stood the witness down and declined to call further evidence.   The result would probably have been an acquittal.   TheCrownthen could have appealed the acquittal on the ground of the judge's erroneous ruling in the usual way, asking for a new trial.    This is what happened inR. v. Banas and Haverkamp(1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 164.  There the Ontario Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from an acquittal made after theCrowndeclined to lead evidence following an adverse ruling.  Martin J.A. stated at p. 169:  We do not think that theCrown, in the circumstances, is precluded from appealing the directed verdict becauseCrowncounsel decided not to continue with the trial which he considered would be fruitless and which would not result in a conviction due to the erroneous exclusion of vital evidence.  We are satisfied that if the trial judge had not excluded the evidence of the intercepted private communications the verdict of the jury would not necessarily have been the same.  If the Crown had followed this course in the case at bar the concerns to which I have alluded would have been avoided.   TheCrowncould not be accused of judge-shopping, since the new trial would be the result of a court decision rather than aCrowndecision.  Concerns for the impartiality of the administration of justice would not arise, since the critical decision would be made by the Court of Appeal where the accused may be fully heard.   And the integrity and dignity of the judicial process would be preserved, in that the adverse ruling would not be circumvented by the act of theCrown, but would be properly set aside by an appellate court.  Finally, Cory J. alludes to the fact that the accused was not prejudiced by way of delay since he was at all times in custody on another matter.  Generally speaking (and leaving to one side the question of trial delay unders. 11(b)of theCharterwhere differing views have been expressed) it is not incumbent upon an accused to demonstrate actual prejudice as a condition of being able to rely on hisCharterrights.  Nor does prejudice figure prominently in the jurisprudence on abuse of process.  Finding myself unconvinced by the reasons enunciated in the court below or by Cory J. for the proposition that abuse of process or breach of theCharterhas not been made out, I find it necessary to embark on my own analysis.  Guidance as to the content of \"oppressive\", \"vexatious\" and \"contrary to the fundamental principles of justice\", the basic test for abuse of process, may be had from the cases which have considered that doctrine.  Those cases invoke concerns for the fairness of the process from the vantage point of the accused as well as the public interest in proper functioning of the judicial system.   The specific concerns raised in this case involve the spectre of judge-shopping, concern for impartiality of the judicial process, and concern for the maintenance of the integrity and dignity of the judicial system and the judges within it.   These concerns must be balanced against the public interest in prosecuting crimes to ascertain whether they outweigh that interest with the result that allowing the proceedings to stand would tarnish the image of the court.  Each of the concerns I have raised may be seen to involve a fundamental principle of justice underlying our community's sense of fair play and justice.   A system that allows the Crown an advantage in choosing or changing judges, a system which either in fact or appearance is partial, a system which permits a judge's ruling to be circumvented other than by the normal appeal process -- such a system would be open to the charge that it offended the fundamental principles of justice upon which our society rests.  By the same token, proceedings which permit such abuses might be characterized as \"vexatious\" or \"unfair\".  The question is whether the apparent concerns are of such gravity that they may be said to outweigh the public interest.  In my view the answer is yes.   The public has an interest in prosecuting crimes as well as in protecting the identity of informers.   But, as I have already suggested, both these interests could have been met by adopting the alternative of calling no further evidence and appealing the resulting acquittal.   In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the public interest justifies or offsets the affront to justice and fairness involved in the course theCrownchose to follow.   The situation, moreover, falls within the rubric of \"the clearest of cases\".   The deviation from the fundamental principles of justice is clear and, being unnecessary, incapable of justification.   I conclude that the requirements for abuse of process are clearly met in this case.  I conclude that theCrown's conduct in staying the proceedings to avoid an adverse judicial ruling and then recommencing them establishes the case for abuse of process.  Having so concluded, it is unnecessary to consider the position under theCharter. I leave the question of remedy to later in these reasons. "

            "In Vaillancourt, this Court dealt with s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  and did not hold that subjective foresight of death was constitutionally mandated for the crime of murder.  Section 213(a) satisfies the objective foreseeability standard, and if all the elements of s. 213(a) are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, a murder conviction can validly and constitutionally obtain.  As I discussed in Martineau, s. 213(a) is entirely different than s. 213(d) in its historical background, in its consistency with the test in Vaillancourt, and in its resemblance to similar provisions enacted in other common law jurisdictions.  Therefore, I must respectfully dissent from my colleague's disposition for the reasons stated in Martineau.  I would allow this appeal, reverse the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, and restore the conviction entered at trial.",

            "XX.             The Court of Appeal examined cases cited by the appellants, but noted that \"the appellants' application for an order quashing the subpoenas in this case was made under s. 24(1) [of the Charter ]\" (p. 447).  The court then followed R. v. Paquette (1987), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Alta.

            "Again the appellants do not have the right to appeal from this decision.  This proceeding in so far as it relates to this issue is clearly criminal in nature.  The concern of the appellants is that as a result of s. 5, witnesses may incriminate themselves.  The appellants did not seek any relief other than a declaration that s. 5 was inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter , and therefore of no force or effect under s. 52  of the Constitution Act, 1982 .  There is nothing in the Criminal Code  or in the Charter  which gives them the right to appeal from a refusal to grant a declaration.",

            "XXVIII.      For third parties to a criminal proceeding, the type of recourse to seek is dictated by the court issuing the order.  A provincial court order should be challenged by an application to a superior court for the extraordinary remedy of certiorari.    This decision can then be appealed pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  A superior court order can be challenged by seeking leave to appeal directly to this Court pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act , R.S.C., 1985, c. S-26 .",
            "XXIX.         The order at issue in this appeal is the issuance of subpoenas to the appellants by the Alberta Provincial Court.  The Court of Appeal for Alberta rejected the appeal launched by the appellants pursuant to s. 813  of the Criminal Code , because of a lack of jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  The Court cited the absence of a statutory right of appeal in the Criminal Code  as fatal to the appellants' application.  It is significant that the Court of Appeal considered that the appellants had in essence made an application for relief based solely on s. 24(1)  of the Charter .  It based this finding on the fact that the appellants had effectively abandoned their application for prohibition, by not pleading it before Berger J., and that Berger J. had based his decision solely on s. 24(1)  of the Charter .",
            "XXX.          In the light of its finding that the present application was made solely pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter , the Court of Appeal held that no right of appeal lay from the decision of Berger J.  Neither the Criminal Code , nor the Charter  (as interpreted in Mills v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 863) provide for such a right.  As such, the Court of Appeal decided it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.",
            "XXXII.        Given that the order in question emanates from a provincial court, the proper procedure to follow, as laid out in Dagenais, is to apply to a superior court judge for the issuance of a writ of certiorari.  As noted in Dagenais, an immediate appeal becomes possible from an order refusing to grant certiorari through the operation of s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .",
            "XXXIII.      As in Primeau, we are faced with a situation where the appellants have not technically complied with the procedures set out in Dagenais.  In our view, however, the jurisdictional question can be resolved in much the same way and for the same reasons as it was solved in Primeau.  Given that neither the appellants, nor the Court of Appeal had the benefit of this Court's reasons in Dagenais, we find that it is sufficient that the appellants applied for s. 24(1)  Charter  relief, which by its nature would be included in the expanded remedial scope of certiorari described in Dagenais.  The Court of Appeal therefore did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal, pursuant to s. 784(1)  of the Criminal Code .  The jurisdiction of this Court follows naturally from the decision of the Court of Appeal, pursuant to s. 40(1)  of the Supreme Court Act  and there is no need to examine the alternative jurisdictional grounds on which leave to appeal was granted.",

            "XXXVI.      The relief they sought, however, was not properly available to them.  The appellants claimed a right to silence on the basis that they were entitled to claim this right by virtue of a status, namely, \"accused person\", \"suspected person\", or \"unindicted co-conspirator\".  This focus on status occludes the focus required by the Charter , which is a focus on the purpose or character of the proceedings.  Thus, the fact that some of the appellants were not accused of anything at the time of their application is not of primary importance.  It also follows from the reasons in S. (R.J.), as elaborated on in British Columbia Securities Commission v. Branch, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 3, released concurrently, and Primeau, supra, that there is no meaningful difference between subpoenas issued in respect of preliminary inquiries and those issued in respect of Jobin's criminal trial.  Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a form of pre-trial interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable, such that a different analysis might have obtained for the reasons expressed in S. (R.J.) and further elaborated on in Branch.",
            "I.                 I say at the outset, as my colleagues point out and as my concurring reasons in R. v. S. (R.J.), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 451, make clear, that the \"primary\" and \"secondary\" appellants, to use my colleagues' terminology, are compellable witnesses at each other's preliminary inquiries and criminal trials.  However, if compelled to testify, they are entitled to the protection of s. 13  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and s. 5  of the Canada Evidence Act , which, like my colleagues, I find does not infringe the Charter .  In addition, should the circumstances be of the kind I outlined in my concurring reasons in S. (R.J.), the appellants could invoke the residual protection of s. 7  of the Charter .  I agree, though, with my colleagues that \"there is no evidence to suggest that the subpoenas issued in this case can be regarded as a form of pre-trial interrogation in respect of any of the appellants or are otherwise objectionable\" (p. 93).  Accordingly, I find that at this stage, the subpoena stage, none of the appellants could successfully invoke the residual protection of s. 7 outlined in my reasons in S. (R.J.) to quash their subpoenas.  As I emphasized in S. (R.J.), it will be rare indeed that the residual protection of s. 7 could be successfully invoked at the subpoena stage.  In this respect, I agree with Berger J., who dealt with the appellants' first application to quash subpoenas, when he stated:  \"[i]t would be dangerous. . . to now predict what evidence will be elicited from each applicant\" and \"I prefer the view that there can be no breach until the proposed witness has testified\" ((1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, at p. 286)."

C-5.  The primary appellants allege that being compelled to testify would violate their right to silence contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  Berger J. dismissed the application without ruling on the validity ofs. 5of theCanada Evidence Act: (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 281, 123 A.R. 220.  VIII.The appellants appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal for Alberta.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction:  (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 445, 131 A.R. 179, 25 W.A.C. 179, 10 C.R.R. (2d) 313.  IX.In the interim between the decision of Berger J. and that of the Court of Appeal, all of the primary appellants waived their rights to a preliminary inquiry in the hope that an appeal route would be located before any person would be compelled to give evidence.  However, following the dismissal of the appellants' appeal to the Court of Appeal, subpoenas were issued in the trial of Reinie Jobin.  X.Jobin's trial was to begin in October 1992.  All the primary and secondary appellants, save Jobin, were once again subpoenaed to testify.  They applied a second time to the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in order to have the subpoenas quashed.  McFadyen J. (as she then was) dismissed the application on the same grounds as Berger J. did.  XI.Jobin's trial finally began on January 4, 1993.  At the outset of Jobin's trial, defence counsel announced that a police statement made by Jobin could be admitted without avoir dire.  On this basis, the Crown agreed not to call any of the subpoenaed witnesses.  Jobin's counsel later asserted the need for avoir dire.  On March 8, 1993, a mistrial was declared because Crown counsel had referred to Jobin's police statement in the opening address to the jury.  XII.On February 4, 1993, leave to appeal was granted at large by this Court, [1993] 1 S.C.R. vii.  The motion book for leave covered three bases for seeking leave.  First, leave was sought from the decision of the Court of Appeal.  Second, and in the alternative, it was sought directly from the decision of Berger J.  Third, and in the alternative, leave was sought directly from the decision of McFadyen J.

        "Facts": " [4]It is important to look at the facts about the search in issue here in the broader context of the investigation of which it formed a part. It is also important to remember that the decisions made by the police as to how to conduct the entry to the residence must be assessed in light of the information reasonably available to them at the time the decision was made. There is no question here that, had police known what they would in fact encounter in the residence, the approach would have been different.  However, as the trial judge wisely observed, “the [appellant] cannot attack the police decision on the basis of circumstances that were not reasonably known to the police”: A.R., vol. I, at p. 16.  [5]The police obtained three search warrants on the morning of November 30, 2005.  Two of the warrants related to dwelling houses and the third to a motor vehicle.  The appellant was not and never had been a target of the investigation.  Rather, the police were investigating what they believed to be “dial-a-dope” operation run by two members of a violent criminal gang.  Based on surveillance and other evidence, the police thought that the appellant’s residence was being used in that operation.  This investigation was not about someone like the appellant who was previously unknown to police and who was keeping a little cocaine in his bedroom. The police nonetheless were entitled to draw reasonable inferences about the risks the search of the Cornell residence posed to them and in relation to the destruction of evidence from the activities and people involved. As I shall outline in a moment, the police had good reasons to believe based, among other things, on their surveillance of the premises, that the Cornell residence, which the appellant had given as his address,  was being used in a drug dealing enterprise carried on by members of a violent criminal gang. They also had good reason to believe that the appellant himself was associated with at least one of these gang members who, through  police surveillance of the Cornell residence, appeared to be welcome there. Attempts to consider the appellant in isolation from these facts are, in my respectful view, highly artificial.  [6]In 2005, the Calgary police received information from a confidential informant that Henry Nguyen and Tuan Tran were running a “dial‑a‑dope” cocaine trafficking operation.   They were believed by police to be members of an organized criminal group known as the “Fresh Off the Boat” gang.  Police also believed that this gang, in the time leading up to the events in issue in this appeal, had been engaged in a violent war with another criminal gang that had resulted in a number of shootings and deaths. As one of the investigators said in his evidence at trial:  . . . it was a real concern for police officers having to attend any residence that may be frequented by persons from these groups, in that they could pose a real threat to the police. We would not want them to react to our presence, take hostages, to fight the police to try to gain their escape, to try to fend off the police while the evidence was destroyed.  So it became a very, very real security risk for the police officers that would be attending these residences.  [A.R., vol. II, at  p. 103]  The trial judge accepted this evidence.  [7]As mentioned, the police applied for, and obtained, search warrants for two residences which they believed were being used in the operation — the Tran residence and the Cornell residence — and, in addition, for a motor vehicle frequently used by Nguyen.  Detective Barrow of the Calgary Police Service swore an Information to Obtain A Search Warrant (“ITO”) relating to the Cornell residence that, among other things, included the following details:  ·An informant had told police that Nguyen and Tran ran a cocaine dial-a-dope operation (para. 11).  ·This information was substantiated by investigation which included surveillance of Tran and Nguyen, checks in various police and other databases and by the opinion of a police officer with long experience and expertise in the investigation of drug trafficking.  ·The activity at the two residences was consistent with them being used as  stash locations where Nguyen would reload his cocaine supply for the dial-a-dope business.  In particular, the ITO stated that Nguyen had made brief visits to the appellant’s residence on four occasions over a period of approximately two weeks. On the last visit, an unknown male accompanied Nguyen back to the vehicle for a short time and then returned to the residence.  ·The Cornell residence was owned by Phuong Kim Thi Le and was occupied by Lorraine Cornell.  ·Nguyen had been taken into custody two months before the search and released.  A mobile phone registered to the appellant as subscriber was found in the car Nguyen was driving at that time. The subscriber information for the telephone showed the appellant’s address as the Cornell residence. The appellant had also given the address of the Cornell residence when he had been involved in a car accident about five months earlier.  ·The tactical team would be required to enter the residence in order to avoid the destruction of evidence by potential occupants and for the safety of both the public and the police because of Nguyen and Tran’s history of violence and association with the organized crime group “Fresh Off the Boat”.  [8]A judge of the Alberta Provincial Court authorized warrants to search the Cornell residence as well as the other residence believed to be Tran’s and a motor vehicle operated by Nguyen.  The Cornell residence was placed under surveillance from the morning of November 30, 2005, until the search warrant was executed shortly before 6:00 that evening.  [9]The situation was complicated by the fact that the police felt that it was important to execute the three warrants as closely in time as possible.   As Constable Smolinski explained in his trial testimony, the police were concerned that if a person inside one residence was able to make a phone call, it might lead to loss of valuable evidence at the other. A tactical team was to be used at both residences and in the stop of the vehicle.  Its job was to secure the site and then turn it over to the investigators who would conduct the search.  [10]At the Cornell residence, the tactical team conducted an unannounced hard entry, sometimes referred to as a “dynamic entry”, by nine police officers with weapons drawn and wearing balaclavas and body armour. Entry involved battering the front door and entering the house while yelling “Police, search warrant”. The only person in the house at the time was the appellant’s brother, who was 29 years old and mentally challenged. He was taken down and handcuffed with his hands behind his back. His emotional distress became quickly apparent and the officer dealing with him removed the handcuffs, took off his balaclava, called the accompanying paramedic to assist and facilitated a call by the man to his mother Lorraine. According to the evidence, from the time of entry to the time that this individual was out of the handcuffs and seated on a couch being comforted by one of the officers was about four minutes: C.A., at para. 40,perSlatter J.A.  As noted by Slatter J.A. in the Court of Appeal, there was some damage to the premises during the entry, but Ms. Cornell testified that she was able to repair it with material she had around the house without incurring any expense: C.A., at para. 31.  [11]The tactical team did not have the warrant with  them when they entered the house. Detective Bent, who was in charge of the investigation and of the search that started as soon as the house was secured by the tactical team,  had a copy of the warrant.  He entered the residence approximately four minutes after the tactical team went in. The lone occupant present in the house at the time of entry did not ask to see the warrant and neither did Lorraine Cornell, although she was shown a copy when she came back to the house not long after Detective Bent’s arrival.  [12]The investigating officers discovered 99.4 grams of cocaine in the corner of the basement bedroom of Jason Cornell, in a box marked “Jason’s stuff”.   Mr. Cornell was later arrested at his place of employment.  He formally admitted that he possessed this cocaine for the purposes of trafficking.

At trial, the evidence pertaining to the New York State homicide was admitted after avoir dire.  The trial judge held that while the evidence was highly prejudicial to the accused, it was relevant and probative to explain why Romeo had left his parents' home five days prior to the shooting and it therefore countered the defence of insanity.

This principle, I noted, \"is perhaps best described in terms of the overarching principle against self-incrimination, which is firmly rooted in the common law and is a fundamental principle of justice under s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \" (p. 577). The use immunity provided by s. 13  of the Charter , together with the s. 7 based derivative-use immunity proposed by my colleague Iacobucci J., will protect witnesses against the possibility of their testimony being used directly as evidence against them, or being used indirectly as a means of gathering derivative incriminatory evidence. In many cases, these forms of immunity will provide adequate protection for the principle against self-incrimination. In some situations, however, forcing a witness to testify will violate the case-to-meet principle in a manner that cannot be remedied by an exclusionary rule. For example, the compelled testimony might reveal an accused's defence strategy, or bring to light crimes of which the state was previously unaware. In these latter cases, attempting to protect the principle against self-incrimination through use immunity and derivative-use immunity would indeed be, as my colleague Sopinka J. notes (at p. 625), \"like closing the barn door after",

            "This issue goes to the validity of the authorization on its face.  The appellant relies on two arguments with respect to minimization.  First, it is argued that when paras. 3(i) and 5(h) of the authorization are read together, the authorization is overbroad and hence unlawful under the Criminal Code  and unreasonable under s. 8  of the Charter .  Second, he adopts the submission of the appellant in Garofoli that the absence of minimizing conditions creates the possibility of interception of a high number of irrelevant private communications, and thereby renders the authorization unreasonable."
        ],
        "Facts": " Aggravated Assault  The appellant and his brother, David Lachance, were convicted by Ferguson Dist. Ct. J., sitting alone, of aggravated assault of Derrick Hollett.  The appellant had become acquainted with Hollett at the Don Jail in Toronto.  In January 1985, the Lachance brothers were involved in trafficking speed with Hollett.  Hollett's debts to them are variously reported as $500 to $4,000.  Wiretap evidence showed that both the appellant and his brother were looking for Hollett to collect the money.  Hollett, however, successfully avoided them despite his promises to pay.  In one particular instance, he made the excuse that he had been arrested for breaking and entering.  He arranged to meet with the Lachance brothers at a donut shop to show them the bail papers, but did not show up.  On March 27, 1985 Hollett was visiting a friend's apartment.  The Lachance brothers arrived at about 7:00 p.m.  Hollett went to the bathroom.  The trial judge found as fact that Hollett emerged from the bathroom concealing a knife in his right hand.  He confronted the appellant, who saw the concealed knife.  The appellant punched Hollett in the face, which the trial judge found to be reasonable force used in self-defence.  The trial judge found that Daniel Lachance did not see the concealed knife, and that Hollett's threatening behaviour was not directed towards Daniel Lachance.  Daniel Lachance moved behind Hollett, held his knife to Hollett's throat, and wounded Hollett.  The appellant took Hollett's knife.  With it, he cut Hollett's face, slit his stomach area, and stabbed him in the stomach and chest.  The wiretap evidence was an important factor in the factual findings.  It confirmed elements of Hollett's testimony.  Hollett might not otherwise have made a very credible witness due to, among other things, his long criminal record.  The trial judge referred in particular to two interceptions made March 28, the day following the stabbing.  He said:  The intercepted communications which were admitted in evidence leave in my mind no doubt whatsoever that both of the accused were intent on confronting Hollett and that they were entirely satisfied with the manner in which Hollett had been dealt with physically.  The words used by them in the intercepted communications are consistent only with the conclusion that they boasted of their physical accomplishment.  Wiretaps The relevant authorizations for wiretaps were obtained with respect to the robbery of a precious metal dealer, Intercontinental Gold, in December, 1984.  Authorizations were obtained on January 31, February 8, and February 27, 1985. Each was obtained on the basis of an affidavit sworn by Sergeant John Lamont.  The intercepted communications tendered as evidence were all obtained under the February 27 authorization.  The  January 31 affidavit names 5 individuals as targets, who the police believed committed the robbery on the basis of information from an informant and other investigation.  The February 8 affidavit is substantially the same, but corrects the addresses given for two of the targets.  The February 27 affidavit repeats the contents of the prior affidavits.  It then adds new facts, set out in para. 1(i).  (i) That subsequently Sergeant Paul Landry, a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force attached to the Hold-Up Squad, has informed and I verily believe:  (i)                   That on the 9th day of February, 1985, he had conversation with an informant, who has not been previously mentioned in this my Affidavit.  (ii)        That this informant told him that Art Szostak and a male he knew only as Ted set up the robbery of Intercontinental Gold previously mentioned in this my Affidavit.  (iii)      That the informant told him that the jewellery stolen from Intercontinental Gold was given to a male party he knew only as \"The Jew\" to sell.  (iv)      That the informant told him that Art Szostak and \"Ted\" have recruited at least three other men to do another robbery for them in the near future.  (At present, it is not known if there are other participants in this planned robbery.)  (v)                 That the informant told him that these three men were Daniel LaChance, his brother David LaChance and Derrick Hollett.  (vi)      That the informant told him that as a result of having been previously investigated by the police for Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, the three men were aware they were known to the police and would take measures to avoid police surveillance. In paragraph 1(j) Sergeant Lamont deposes that based on his own observations and investigations, he verily believes that the information obtained by Sergeant Landry from the informant is correct.  Later, in para. 10 of the affidavit, Sergeant Lamont repeats his belief that the targets are uncooperative and surveillance-conscious.  He deposes that the targets form a close-knit group of friends and relatives, so that any attempt to involve an undercover police officer would be futile.  He deposes that the only remaining investigative step would be to question the targets, which would be highly unlikely to assist the investigation.  He therefore concludes that the only practical investigative technique would be to intercept the private communications of the targets.  In Hollett's testimony at trial, it is apparent that he is the informant referred to in Sergeant Lamont's affidavit.  He testified in chief that he was arrested for cocaine possession in January or February 1985.  He testified in cross-examination that he lied when he told David and Daniel Lachance that he was arrested for breaking and entering, but that he lied in order to cover up his involvement with the Hold-Up Squad.  In re-examination he testified that sometime in February 1985 he began working for the Hold-Up Squad as an informant.  He told them of the involvement of the Lachance brothers in the Intercontinental Gold robbery.  He was asked by the Hold-Up Squad to \"get back in\" with the Lachance brothers, which he attempted to do.  He was aware that when he telephoned the Lachance brothers, the telephones were wiretapped.  The Hold-Up Squad asked him to arrange a meeting with the Lachance brothers, and to wear a body pak for the meeting.  Hollett agreed to do this, although he was skeptical about the idea.  Sergeant Lamont's testimony onvoir direalso supports the inference that Hollett was the informant referred to in the affidavit.  He testified in chief that part of the information implicating the Lachance brothers in the robbery was obtained from the informant, Hollett.  In cross-examination he testified that he first met Hollett in late February 1985, although his partner had had earlier contact with him.  On cross-examination he was asked why Hollett was named on the authorization.  He testified that the police had believed other offences were about to take place, although Hollett was not a suspect in relation to the offences listed in the authorization.

        "Facts": " In neither case are the facts disputed.  The facts and procedural history of each case may be summarized as follows:  R. v. Hess  The appellant Victor John Hess was charged in 1985 unders.146(1)of theCriminal Code.  He initially entered a plea of guilty, but was permitted to change his plea when other cases raised doubts as to the constitutionality of the section.  By way of motion after plea, he raised the unconstitutionality of the section as a defence, admitting for the purposes of the motion that an act of sexual intercourse had taken place and that the complainant was under the age of fourteen years and the appellant was over the age of eighteen years.  Graham Prov. Ct. J. allowed the motion, on the grounds thats.146(1)infringeds. 15of theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedomsby providing protection to females but not to males under fourteen years of age. He was of the view that it had not been demonstrated that the infringement was justified under s. 1, and that although biological differences between males and females might once have been grounds for affording greater protection to the latter, it was doubtful that this could be justified in these times.  The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal, in a judgment rendered February 3, 1988, and ordered a new trial: 25 O.A.C. 43, 40 C.C.C. (3d) 193.   Dubin J.A., writing for the Court, first noted that the impugned legislation had been repealed. He then considered whether a contravention of s. 15 had been made out. In his view, the fact that young males under fourteen were not given the same protection as young females under fourteen did not violate s. 15. Under that section, it was necessary to determine \"whether the law was reasonable or fair, having regard to its purpose and effect\". Dubin J.A., noting the grave consequences which result to the victim and society and relying on the British Columbia Court of Appeal's decision inR. v. Ferguson(1987), 16 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, concluded that it was neither unfair nor irrational for Parliament to have treated sexual intercourse with a female under fourteen as a more serious offence.  R. v. Nguyen  The appellant Van Hung Nguyen was charged with sexual assault and contravention of s. 146(1).  At the preliminary hearing, the Crown entered a stay of proceedings on the sexual assault charge, but Nguyen was ordered to stand trial on the second charge.  He brought a preliminary motion challenging the validity of s. 146(1) on the grounds that it infringeds. 7ands. 15of theCharter.  The Court of Queen's Bench dismissed the motion and the trial proceeded.  The evidence established that sexual intercourse had taken place, that the complainant was twelve years old at the time, and that the complainant did not indicate her lack of consent to the appellant because she was too scared.  Nguyen was convicted and sentenced to fifteen months' incarceration.  The Manitoba Court of Appeal dismissed Nguyen's appeal: (1989), 57 Man. R. (2d) 267, [1989] 3 W.W.R. 646.   LyonJ.A., writing for the Court, relied on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inHess, to conclude that there was no violation of s. 15, as well as the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal inR. v. Fergusonto conclude that although s. 146(1) breacheds. 7of theCharter, that breach was saved bys.1.  He noted incidentally that whileFergusonconcerned an accused who honestly but mistakenly believed that the complainant was sixteen years old, in the present case there was no suggestion that the appellant was under any misapprehension as to the complainant's age. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on October 19, 1989, [1989] 2 S.C.R. ix. "

        "Facts": " In August 1987, the appellant, Donald Victor Butler, opened the Avenue Video Boutique located in Winnipeg, Manitoba.  The shop sells and rents \"hard core\" videotapes and magazines as well as sexual paraphernalia.  Outside the store is a sign which reads:  \"Avenue Video Boutique; a private members only adult video/visual club.  Notice:  if sex oriented material offends you, please do not enter.  No admittance to persons under 18 years.  On August 21, 1987, the City of Winnipeg Police entered the appellant's store with a search warrant and seized all the inventory.  The appellant was charged with 173 counts in the first indictment:  three counts of selling obscene material contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34 (now s. 163(2)(a)), 41 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a) (now s. 163(1)(a)) of theCriminal Code, 128 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Codeand one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary tos. 159(2)(a) of theCriminal Code.  On October 19, 1987, the appellant reopened the store at the same location.  As a result of a police operation a search warrant was executed on October 29, 1987, resulting in the arrest of an employee, Norma McCord.  The appellant was arrested at a later date.  A joint indictment was laid against the appellant doing business as Avenue Video Boutique and Norma McCord.  The joint indictment contains 77 counts under s. 159 (now s. 163) of theCriminal Code:  two counts of selling obscene material contrary to s. 159(2)(a), 73 counts of possessing obscene material for the purpose of distribution contrary to s. 159(1)(a), one count of possessing obscene material for the purpose of sale contrary to s. 159(2)(a) and one count of exposing obscene material to public view contrary to s. 159(2)(a).  The trial judge convicted the appellant on eight counts relating to eight films.  Convictions were entered against the co‑accused McCord with respect to two counts relating to two of the films.  Fines of $1,000 per offence were imposed on the appellant.  Acquittals were entered on the remaining charges.  The Crown appealed the 242 acquittals with respect to the appellant and the appellant cross‑appealed the convictions.  The majority of the Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and entered convictions for the appellant with respect to all of the counts, Twaddle and Helper JJ.A. dissenting.  Court of Queen's Bench(1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 97  Wright J. first considered whether the materials were obscene within the meaning ofs. 163(8)of theCriminal Code.  He noted that Canadian courts have interpreted the application of the \"community standards\" test to mean that as long as the trier of fact does not apply his or her subjective personal views but seeks objectively to ascertain the community standard, he or she may resolve that issue simply by drawing on his or her \"experience\".  Wright J. expressed serious difficulties in applying the community standards test, stating that to render a factual decision on the basis of experience is contrary to the judicial role and that he regards his own views drawn from his \"experience\" to be unreliable.  However, Wright J. was able to conclude on the basis of previous case law that the materials in question were obscene (at p. 113):  In the context of my own inability to confidently draw on my experience, and my belief, in any event, that it is incongruous and inconsistent with basic judicial legal principles to do so, normally I would be inclined to hold that the requisite community standard of tolerance has not been proved as an essential ingredient of the Crown's case and all the charges should be dismissed.  However, it is clear, from a review of the case‑law binding on me that independent of the manner in which a trial judge is directed to measure obscenity, material of the kind before the court has been well established as obscene and must continue to be regarded as obscene within theCriminal Codedefinition.  Applying the Canadian decisions on obscenity since the inclusion of s. 163 in theCriminal Code, Wright J. found that there was no doubt that the videos and magazines in the present case fall into the category of \"hard porn\" and that the sexual devices are similar to the kind of sexual paraphernalia held by this Court inDechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951, andGermain v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 241, to fall under the obscenity definition.  Accordingly, he found that all of the materials referred to in the various charges in the indictments are obscene according to the case law interpretation of s. 163(8).  Wright J. then concluded that the obscene material was protected bys. 2(b)of theCharter.  Following the principles inIrwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, he noted that obscene expression reflected in the material certainly conveys meaning and is entitled to protection provided the form of expression is not violent.  In conducting the s. 1 analysis, Wright J. was of the view that legislation which seeks to proscribe a fundamental freedom must have as its objective a more precise purpose than simply to control the morals of society or to encourage decency.  He wrote, at p. 121:  The aim must be directed more specifically to objectives such as equality concerns, or otherCharterrights, or particular human rights; otherwise, the basic freedoms in theCharterwill be subject to restrictions that arise from very personal and subjective opinions of right and wrong that will be impossible to identify . . . .  Examples of more precise aims or bases for restrictions will be:  (1)The protection of people from involuntary exposure to pornographic material;  (2)the protection of the vulnerable, for example children, from either exposure or participation;  (3)the prevention of the circulation of pornographic material that effectively reduces the human or equality or otherCharterrights of individuals.  This may arise, and often will arise, in material that mixes sex with violence or cruelty, or otherwise dehumanizes women or men.  Applying these standards, he concluded that on aprima faciebasis, only those materials which contained scenes involving violence or cruelty intermingled with sexual activity or depicted lack of consent to sexual contact or otherwise could be said to dehumanize men or women in a sexual context were legitimately proscribed under s. 1.  With respect to the material and sexual devices covered by the remaining counts he said, at pp. 124-25:  The material covered by the remaining counts in the indictments, relating to the magazines and the videos, reflects consensual activity by adult individuals not involving force, duress or cruelty.  In this context, I am unable to conclude that the depiction of the human body or any of its parts, no matter how explicitly presented, or the visual presentation of masturbation, group sex or other heterosexual or homosexual activity, including incestuous relations,prima facierelate to sufficiently specific concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society to justify restricting or limiting the basic freedom permitting them to be expressed.  The same reasoning applies in respect of the material before the court described as sexual toys or devices.  The Crown has failed to bring forward cogent and persuasive evidence to demonstrate the specific objectives sought to be achieved, and to show that such objectives justify the limits on freedom of expression which the impugned legislation seeks to bring about.
